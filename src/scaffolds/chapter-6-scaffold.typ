#rule("20", "MISCONDUCT AND ITS SANCTIONS")[
]

#subrule("20.1", "MINOR MISCONDUCT")[
  Minor misconduct offences are not subject to sanctions. It is the 1 st
  referee’s duty to prevent the teams from approaching the sanctioning
  level.
  5.1.2, 21.3
  This is done in two stages:
  Stage 1: by issuing a verbal warning through the captain;
  Stage 2: by use of a YELLOW CARD to a team member. This formal
  warning is not in itself a sanction but a symbol that the team member
  (and by extension the team) has reached the sanctioning level for
  the match. It is recorded in the score sheet but has no immediate
  consequences.
