  It is made of 10 cm square mesh. At its top and bottom there are two
  7-10 cm wide horizontal bands made of two-fold canvas, preferably in
  dark blue or bright colours, sewn along its full length. Each extremity
  of the upper band has a hole through which passes a cord fastening
  the upper band to the posts to keep the top of the net stretched taut.
  Within the bands, there is a flexible cable in the upper one and a cord
  in the bottom one for fastening the net to the posts and keeping its top
  and bottom taut. It is permissible to have advertising on the horizontal
  bands of the net.
  For FIVB, World and Official Competitions, an 8.0 m net with
  smaller meshes and brandings displayed between the ends of
