  PART 3
  DEFINITIONS
  PROTOCOL
  The series of events before the start of the match, including the toss, the warming-up session,
  presentation of the teams and referees described in the Specific Competition Handbook.
  COMPETITION/ CONTROL AREA
  The Competition/ Control Area is a corridor around the playing court and free zone, which includes
  all spaces up to the outer barriers or delimitation fence. See diagram/fig 1a.
  ZONES
  These are sections within the playing area (i.e. playing court and free zone) as defined for a specific
  purpose (or with special restrictions) within the rule text. These include: Service Zone & Free Zone.
  LOWER SPACE
  This is the space defined as its upper part by the bottom of the net and the cord joining it to the
  posts, at the sides by the posts, and the bottom by the playing surface.
  CROSSING SPACE
  The crossing space is defined by:
  –  The horizontal band at the top of the net
  –  The antennae and their extension
  –  The ceiling
  The ball must cross to the opponent’s COURT through the crossing space.
  EXTERNAL SPACE
  The external space is in the vertical plane of the net outside of the crossing and lower spaces.
  UNLESS BY AGREEMENT OF FIVB
  This statement recognizes that while there are regulations on the standards and specification of
  equipment and facilities, there are occasions when special arrangements can be made by FIVB in
  order to promote the game of Beach Volleyball or to test new conditions.
  FIVB STANDARDS
  The technical specifications or limits as defined by FIVB to the manufacturers of equipment.
  FAULT
  a) A playing action contrary to the rules.
  b) A rule violation other than a playing action.
  FIRST HIT OF THE TEAM
  There are three cases, when the playing action is considered first hit of the team:
  – Service reception
  – Receiving an attack of the opponent team
  – Playing the ball rebounding from opponent’s block
  RALLY POINT
  This is the system of scoring a point whenever a rally is won.
  PART 3: DEFINITIONS
  TECHNICAL TIME-OUT
  This special mandatory time-out is, in addition to time-outs, to allow the promotion of Beach
  Volleyball, analysis of the play and to allow additional commercial opportunities. Technical Time-
  Outs are mandatory for FIVB, World and Official competitions.
  INTERVAL
  The time between sets. The change of courts in the third (deciding) set is not to be regarded as
  an interval.
  INTERFERING
  Any action which will create an advantage against the opponent team or any action which prevents
  an opponent from playing the ball.
  OUTSIDE OBJECT
  An object or a person which while outside the playing court or close to the limit of the free playing
  space provides an obstruction to the flight of the ball. For example: Overhead lights, the referee’s
  chair, TV equipment, scorer’s table, and net posts. Outside objects do not include the antennae
  since they are considered as the part of the net.
  BALL RETRIEVERS
  These are personnel whose job it is to maintain the flow of the game by rolling the ball to the
  server between rallies.
  SAND LEVELLERS (RAKERS)
  These court assistants use long rakes or long poles with flattened ends to smooth out the sand
  especially around the court lines and across the central axis of the court between the posts.
