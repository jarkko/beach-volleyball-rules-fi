The referee should be able to give the players a precise and correct definition of ball “in” clarifying any misinterpretation.

  [Yes. With the possible exception of setting overhand with fingers, Volleyball hits involve a rebound from the contact point.

  [Is it legal to block a sky service ball into the net and then play it the second time to your partner?],
  [No. This is a fault. It is not legal to block a service. The first contact is not legal so the 1st referee should have whistled a fault as soon as the player blocked the ball.],

  [If a player is late in blocking and in doing so  is approximately 1 meter from the net, can he/she, if the ball touches his/her hands, play the ball for  a second consecutive time Click Here for Video],
  [There is no definition of “close to the net”. The referee must penalize it as a double contact fault if he/she believes the first contact of this player did not satisfy the requirements of a block. The distance from the net is important, as a block must be completed “close to the  net”. However, a taller player’s body may be further from the net than a smaller one, yet the hands can be over the net – so “close to the net” can be relative, and depend on a variety of factors.],

#case(
  "5.8.3",
  [If the ball is coming to the net, is the blocking player allowed to redirect the ball in any position?],
  [While the block is a defensive action it does not follow the same criteria as a hard driven ball 25 defence. The referee should not allow prolonged contact ( i.e., catch) of the block. The ball can be redirected by a block provided that it satisfies the definition of a block and the contact time is not prolonged.],
