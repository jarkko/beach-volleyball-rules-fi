  PREFACE    Volleyball is a great game – just ask the millions of people who play it, watch it, analyze it and referee it. It has been actively promoted in recent years and has developed tremendously as a top competitive sport. Increased excitement, speed, explosive action, a clean healthy image and huge TV audience figures have created an impetus to develop the game even further, to make it simpler and more attractive to an even wider range of viewing public.  However, to make a correct and uniform application of the rules on a world stage is also very important for the further development of the game. This Casebook is a collection of plays with Official Rulings approved by the Rules of the Game and Refereeing Commission. These rulings expand on and clarify the spirit and meaning of the Official Rules, and are the official interpretations to be followed during all competitions.  It is worth noting that the referee is the one who puts the rules into practice. For the correct application of the rules, the referees not only have to know the rules faultlessly but have to apply them decisively and correctly within the context of the game. The more important thing is that they should acquire and understand the basic principles behind the rule. If not, they would have great difficulty in applying them properly. This is especially true when a situation occurs which has not been clearly stated in the rules; the referees can now correctly make decisions with authority. Remember that "The referee has the power to decide any matter involving the game, including those not provided for in the rules". Hence, only on the basis of full acquisition of those fundamental principles can this be done.  Remember also that the rules characterise the game, set the limits, define fairness, legalise techniques, provide a means of educating and form the basis for socialising. All of these aspects are important.  This Casebook is based upon the 2021-2024 edition of the Rule Text whose mandate was approved by the FIVB Congress held for the first time, in a virtual format, in February 2021.   Several cases appearing in this Casebook have been illustrated with video clips, to help the understanding of the situations and make the cases more interesting and attractive. These cases are indicated at the description. Click where indicated and you can watch the video.  We thank those involved for their understanding and support.

   PART I - THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF APPLICATION    The referee stays in the background but at the same time acts to promote the game in the best light,  and in this way the game is attractive to a wider audience.   We want the game to be popular – making an attractive show is the way to do that.    THE RULES FOR THE CASEBOOK 2024 EDITION  The 2024 Casebook is a reflection of the rules, which were put into effect by the different FIVB Congresses through the years. While other rules and philosophical changes are always likely to be considered, as a sport and its society changes, it is worth remembering that the rulings shown here are those relating to the rules in force today.  In the appendix, the case numbers are listed together with the corresponding rules.   The case numbers are linked with the cases.                                Casebook 2024        Page 5/55

CAPTAIN                              Casebook 2024 Page 6/55
1.1   A prosthetic leg, a leg support, a plaster cast for a damaged wrist.   Is such a device allowed?   
Ruling   It is important to distinguish between items which have the potential to hurt or injure others from supporting or fabric materials. So the hard plaster cast would not be allowed but a padded leg brace would be allowed.  The case of the forearm support it must not provide additional control of the ball.   The rules allow a player to wear compression devices for injury protection, as prescribed by Rule 4.5.3.   Rules 4.5.1, 4.5.3   1.2   Is a player allowed to play wearing a ring which is likely to cause injury?   Ruling   Due to the risk of injury, a player must remove the ring, or have it taped.   Rule 4.5.1   
   Ruling   Beyond the limits of Rule 5.1.2, he or she should warn the game captain with no penalty, as stated in Rule 21.1.  If the behavior continues, the game captain should be sanctioned for rude conduct with a red card (point and service to the opponents).   Rules 5.1.2, 20.1, 20.2, 21.2, 21.3.1, Diagram 9   
1.4    VIDEO   The game captain asked the 1streferee for a line-up check.   Is this allowed?   
Ruling   Yes. However, the right to make this request should not be abused and so evaluated by the referee as an intention to delay the game by a team. Only detailed information about his/her own team may be provided. For the opponent team the only  information  that  will  be  provided  will  be  whether  or  not  the  players  are  correctly positioned. No information will be given about which players are front or back row players.   Rule 5.1.2.2   1.5   Is the referee’s decision final? May he/she change  his/her own decision if the team protests?   Ruling   Yes. The referee may change his/her own decision if  he/she became aware of his/her mistake before the  next service.   On the other hand, the teams are not allowed to  protest against normal referee decisions.   Rules 5.1.2.1, 23.2.4   
1.3   What is the proper response by the 1st referee if a   game  captain  constantly  questions  1streferee   decisions?

1.6    VIDEO  Are coaches permitted to talk to the 2nd referee  during the match about decisions or protests?   Ruling   Only the game captain is authorized to speak to the  referees to request explanations. The coach is not  authorized to do so.   Rules 5.1.2, 5.2.3.4, 21.1, 21.2, 21.3   1.7   May the assistant coach or player press the buzzer for  T/O?   Ruling   Yes – but the coach must still give the official hand signal,  even if tablets are in use to make such requests.   Rules 5.2.1, 5.2.3.3, 5.3.1   1.8    VIDEO  Where may the coach move during the match? Ruling The coach, and only the coach, has the right to walk in the free zone during the match between the extension of the attack line and the warm-up area without disturbing the game and the work of the line judge/2nd referee .                                                 Rules 5.2.1,5.2.3.1, 5.2.3.4 1.9   If injured or disabled, can the coach be allowed to use  crutches in the free zone to perform his/her duties  during the match?   
Ruling   To stand or walk with crutches is not forbidden for  the coach.   
1.10    VIDEO   Is it allowed for the coach or assistant coach to assist  the players warming up with balls during the interval  between sets in the free zone?   
Ruling   No. These persons have the right to do it solely during  the official warming up before the match. Only the  players have the right to warm up in the free zone   behind his/her own court between sets. If this happens, the referees should  instruct the coach or assistant coach in a polite way  to return to the team’s bench.   Rules 4.2.4, 5.3.1   1.11    VIDEO   Is it allowed that during the warming up any person from the team’s officials stay in the opponent free zone or court? 
Ruling In case of common official warming-up at the net the  general principle is, that the warm-up can be practised  solely in the team’s OWN playing area.  Coaches are allowed to stand near the net to help prevent injuries, or in the opponent free zone when supervising  their team. But this should be solely a supervisory or injury prevention role. In  case  of  separate  official  warming  up  the  entire  playing  area  may  be  used  by  the  team  actually  warming with the balls at the net. The other team can  use  the  free  zone  behind  its  own  court,  without  disturbing the team at the net.                                      Guidelines and Instructions, 2024

                                     THE UNIFORM                          Casebook 2024     Page 8/55 
1.11.1 In  the  women’s  World  Cup,  an  extra  assistant  coach/ team official was observed serving the ball  to specific players inside the court during the warm  up. The FIVB Technical Delegate requested the referees  to stop this activity, was it correct?   
Ruling   Correct action.   The rule stipulates, that only the five officials on the  bench may take part in the official warm up. Extra persons who are not on the O2bis or other team  officials (e.g. team manager) have no right to take part  neither during the non official warming up, nor during  the  official  warming  up  at  the  net.  Only  the  physiotherapist if not amongst the 5 officials on the  bench, may assist with the warm up, but only until the  start of the official (net) warm up.   The referees should bring this sort of activity to the  notice of the FIVB TD.   Rule 4.1.1   1.11.2 NEW    VIDEO During the warm up on the court, it was observed that additional coaches were positioned around the court, outside the advertising panels, and actively warming up with the players who were inside the court (i.e. not simply retrieving balls). Is this permitted? 
Ruling This is not permitted. Only those registered within the scoresheet may enter the Field Of Play (FOP). And only those coaches may take part in the warm up. Clearly, the extra coaches were actively involved in the preparation of the team in this case. The Referees should inform the FIVB TD about this practice and it should be stopped. Rule 4.2.2 1.11.3    VIDEO  Coaches were observed on the opponent’s side of the  court serving or spiking balls towards members of  their own team. Should this be permitted?   
Ruling   No. This should not be permitted.   However, it is allowed for the officials appearing on  the team list to be close to the posts in order to avoid  that a ball dropping down from the net can create a  dangerous situation for the players.  But to stay on the opponent’s side and actively  participate in the warming up is forbidden.      Guidelines and Instructions....   
1.12    VIDEO  During the Men’s World Cup, a team had 2 players,  who  wore  jerseys  with  number  21  and  22  respectively. Is it allowed?   
Ruling   For normal matches the rules allow to number the  players up to 20.   However, in FIVB, World and Official Competitions  for  Seniors,  which  includes  the  World  Cup,  it  is  permitted  to  wear  numbers  greater  than  20.  The  actual competition regulation should determine the  upper limit of players’ numbers.   Rule 4.3.3.   

--- Page 10 ---
 1.13    NEW In a match, the team had two Liberos. Each had on a uniform which was different from the other and different from the rest of the team. Is this permitted?   
Ruling Yes. There is no need for each Libero to have the same color or design of uniform. In fact, this may actually help the spectators and the TV commentators to understand the role of each player.   Rule 19.2                                   
 Casebook 2024 Page 9/55 
1.14       VIDEO   A team had several players wearing compression  pads. Some of these pads were black, some white.  Is it allowed to wear different colored compression  pads?   
Ruling   For FIVB, World and Official competitions for Seniors  these devices must be of the same colour as the  corresponding part of the uniform, but the black,  white and neutral colours are accepted. However if  teams  are  using  compression  pads,  they  must  be  uniform in colour /design for all the players.   During  FIVB  World  and  Official  Competitions  the  referees must control this and inform of any violation  to the FIVB Technical Delegate who is the person  entitled to take the final decision on this matter.  However, for competitions not listed above, the rule  says nothing about the uniformity of the colour of the  compression pads used by multiple players.   Rule 4.5.3. FIVB Event Regulations   
1.15  Several team members during the general warm up  wore garments over their official uniform or instead  of  their  uniform.  It  was  noticed  that  because  no  numbers  were  visible,  this  prevented  proper  confirmation that the players on court matched the  ID cards presented. Should this be permitted?   
Ruling   The principle is, that all players should be in uniform  from the moment they enter the court to warm up.  In some top events the current Protocol before the  match is conducted by a specialist Sport Presentation   team. In these cases, the regulation might be  different. The referees should be well informed  about this item.

 CHAPTER 2 – PLAYING FORMAT   POSITIONAL AND ROTATIONAL FAULTS                                                     Casebook 2024 Page 10/55  
2.1   The  team’s  setter  from  position  1  was  standing  clearly in front of player position 2, but jumped at the  moment before the service hit.   Is this a legal position?   
Ruling   Fault. When players jump from the floor, they retain  the position that they had from their last contact with  the floor. Therefore, while the back row player was  in the air, the point of his last contact with the floor  was “retained”.             Rules 7.4, 7.4.2, 7.4.3, 7.5 2.2   If the foot of a player on court is in contact with the  opponent court at the service hit, is this a fault?   Ruling   No.   This  situation  should  only  be  considered  when  a player penetrates into the opponent’s court over the center line during the rally.   Rules 1.3.3, 7.4  
2.3  A team was given incorrect information about which player was to serve. Play continued. This incorrect information was noticed at a later point in the set.  What happens now?   
Ruling   The teams must revert to as close to their original line-up as possible.   The score is taken back to the point where the wrong information was given. The correct server is allowed to serve. However, the already issued warnings/ sanctions remain valid.  This event must be recorded on the score sheet.   2.4    VIDEO  The teams were not ready to play because five (5) or seven (7) players were on court when the 1st referee  was ready to whistle for service.   What should have occurred?   
Ruling   The 1st referee should whistle  for  service  when  he/she is sure that the teams are ready to play and  that the server is in possession of the ball. There must always be 6 players per team in play.   Because the 1st referee noticed the mistake before he/she whistled for service, he/she must award a  delay sanction to the team at fault. The next team to  serve depends on the type of delay sanction.   But if the 1st referee still whistled for service when  only 5 or 7 players were on court, he/she must stop  the  rally  immediately  and  replay  without  any  sanction.   If the situation is discovered after the end of the next  rally, the result of this rally should be cancelled and  replayed without any sanction.   If nobody discovered the situation, or did so after the  start of the next rally, the rally played with 5 (or 7)  players of a team cannot be replayed.     Rules 7.3.1., 7.5, 12.3   

--- Page 12 ---
                 2.7 NEW    VIDEO 1    VIDEO 2 At the service hit, for the receiving team, the player in position 1 had the heel of his rear foot (relative to the centre line) level with the toe of the front foot of the position 2 player. How should the 2nd referee respond?   
Ruling The 2nd referee should do nothing. This is a legal position according to the modified rules 2021-24 The team commit a positional fault, if any player is not in his/her correct position at the moment the ball is hit by the server. To try to reduce the number of positional calls by referees and to reflect the current reality of 2nd row  players switching positions, referees in particular need only whistle if a back row player is completely in front of the corresponding front row player at the service hit. Feet on the ground determine the position Rule 7 Item 5, Rules 1.3.3, 7.4.3.1, 7.5.2  Refereeing Guidelines & Instructions                              Casebook 2024  Page 11/55 
 Ruling   Only a single point should be awarded, due to the  rotational fault, regardless of which team “won” the  rally.   Rule 7.7.1.1   2.6    VIDEO  If the foot of a player on court is in contact with the  free zone at the service hit, is this a fault?   Ruling   Yes, fault, because in the moment of the service hit  all players except the server must be within their own  court. Consequently, it is a fault for a player on court  to be in contact with the free zone in the moment of  service.   Rules 7.4   
2.5.   After a service, which was executed by the wrong   server,  the  ball  went  out.  When  the  rally  was   finished,  the  scorer  signaled  the  rotational  fault.   How many points do the receiving team receive?

 CHAPTER 3 – PLAYING ACTIONS  
                                               
 Casebook 2024  Page 12/55  
3.1   The 1st hit flew outside of the antenna. The setter  pursued the ball into the opponent’s free zone and  tried to play it back – but the ball went towards the  court and net on the opponent’s side.   The 1st referee whistled and signaled “ball out”.   At what moment does the ball become “out”?   
Ruling   This  ball  had  become   “out”   when  it  had  left  completely  the  space  above  the  free  zone  and  entered the space above the court on the opponent’s  side of the net.   Rules 10.1.2, 10.1.2.2   
3.2   Can a player legally hit the ball with the palm of one  hand up?   Ruling   Yes, he can.   The hit must be judged by the quality of the ball  contact – whether  or not the ball was caught and/or thrown. The 1st  referee must not be too hasty in whistling this play  unless  he  can  clearly  see  that  the  ball  is  caught  and/or thrown.   Rules 9.2.1, 9.2.2, 9.3.3, 9.3.4   
3.3   During a first hit the ball rebounded from one arm  to the other and then onto the chest of a player  during one action and without being caught or  thrown. The 1st referee allowed the game to  continue.   Is this correct?   
Ruling   The decision of the 1st referee was correct. “First hit”  cases, in which successive contacts are allowed, are:  1.  Reception of the service.   2.   Reception of an attack hit. This can be either a   soft or a hard attack.   3.   Reception of a ball blocked by one’s own team.   4.   Reception of a ball blocked by the opponent.   A player has the right to make successive contacts at   the first hit, so long as he/she makes only one action  to play the ball. It is possible, however, to whistle a  “catch” or “throw” on the first hit if two different  phases  (first  catch,  then  throw)  are  recognized  within the action.   Rules 9.2.3.2, 14.2, Refereeing Guidelines and   Instructions   3.4    VIDEO A blocker “redirected” the ball to the floor of the  opponents.   Is this legal?   
Ruling   This depends on whether the ball is caught or thrown  (fault) rather than rebounding (no fault). It is legal to  block the ball and direct it back to the opponent’s  court,  but  the  illegal  contact  of  “catch”  can  be  whistled during blocking.   Rule 9.2.2   
3.5  NEW    VIDEO The left side attacker played the ball with two hands in a throwing action. How should the 1st referee judge the action? 
Ruling   There is nothing to prevent a player making a two handed attack. However, this not be done using a catch and throw action. The ball in this clip is contacted almost behind the player’s head and released more than 50 cm later. This is a CATCH. Rule 9.2.2

                                    3.10   NEW A player chased the ball out of court, then took support from the score table to return the ball to his team. The contact with the ball was over the end of the score table which was on the opponent’s side of the net. The 1st referee took no action and allowed play to continue. Did the player have the right to play the ball from this position?     
Ruling Yes. This was a very spectacular action. According to the rule text, the ball may be retrieved from over the complete length of the score table, even the part on the side of the opponent. So this was a legal play and the 1st referee was correct to allow the rally to continue. Rule 9         Casebook 2024 Page 13/55 
3.6    VIDEO      Ruling   Legal play. Outside his/her own side of the free zone, a player is allowed to play a ball and even take  support to hit the ball. This would include his/her   own team bench since this is outside the free zone.  The same action is forbidden on the opponent’s side  of the net.   Rules 9, 9.1.3, 10.1.2   3.7    VIDEO   During  a  rally,  a  player  chased  the  ball  into  the  spectator stands. Just as she was about to hit the ball,  a spectator reached up to catch the ball. The coach  requested  a  replay  because  of  the  spectator’s  interference. The referee refused. Was this a correct  decision of the 1st referee?   
Ruling   Yes. The player is allowed to retrieve the ball from  anywhere outside her own side of the playing area,  including the team bench/ spectator seats, etc.   On the other hand, while the player has priority for  the ball within the playing area, she has no such  priority outside of the playing area.   Rules 9, 9.1.3   3.8   Must the 1st referee whistle for a handling fault if the  player is making a spectacular recovery?   Ruling   The referee should consider the principle of “keep  the ball flying”. It means, if a player makes a quick  movement and a big effort to recover the ball, and  during the hit a slight double contact has occurred,  he/she  must  be  less  severe,  than  in  a  normal  situation   Refereeing Guidelines and Instructions  Rule 9.7   3.9   A ball went off the blocker A’s head, over the antenna  into the free zone of ‘B’. A player of ‘A’ pursued the  ball  to  play   it   back   to   his   side   of   the   net.    Is it possible to play it back like this?   
Ruling   Yes.  The  ball  passed  over  the  antenna  into  the  opponent’s free zone partially through the external  space. Therefore, it was legal for team ‘A’ to return  the ball to its own court through the external space  on the same side of the court. Line judges should not  signal  while  the  ball  moves  in  this  way  until  the  moment it is finally out of play.   Rule 10.1.2   
3.11  Should the line judge signal when after the second  hit of a team the ball crosses the net plane through  the external space into the opponent’s free zone?   
Ruling   No, to judge this ball is not the duty of the line judge.   Rules 8.4.1, 8.4.2, 9.1,  10.1.2, 10.1.2.1, 10.1.2.2   
A player  jumped  into  the  air  over  the  advertising panels trying to   retrieve the ball  near the spectator seats on his own side of the net.   After contacting the ball, he landed in the seats. Is  this a legal action?

3.12  Team A’s setter hit the ball above the net so that at  the moment of the hit his/her fingers were in the  opponent’s space. After the set the ball flew parallel  to the net toward an attacker.   The blocker of team B touched the ball in team A’s  space, so that the team A player could not execute  the attack hit.   How should the 1st referee decide?   
Ruling   Each team must play the ball within its own playing  area and space (except in the case of Rule 10.1.2).  Above the top of the net, the position of the hand  should be considered.   Therefore, since the setter has hit the ball in the  opponent’s  space,  the  setter  committed  a    fault.   The blocker also committed a fault by touching the  ball in the opponent’s space before the attack hit,  because above the top of the net, the position of the  hand should be considered.   However, only the first fault is penalized.   To hit the ball in the opponent’s space under the net  is different. Here the position of the ball should be  counted, i.e. the play is illegal only if the ball has  completely crossed the vertical plane of the net Rule 9 3.13    VIDEO   May the coach standing in a legal position in his/her  free  zone  catch  the  ball  flying  over  the  antenna,  when an opponent player is running to replay it?   
Ruling   No.   Any team member, including the coach, has no right  to prevent an opponent player from replaying the  ball crossing the net plane outside the crossing space.  It does not matter if the action of the team member  to hit the ball was intentional or unintentional. It  means, that the coach standing legally in his/her free  zone  must  “give  way”  if  an  opponent  player  is  running to replay and return the ball.   Rule 10.1.2.2.   3.13.1    VIDEO After a bad reception of team B, the ball was flying  outside the crossing space towards the opponent's  free zone. A player from this team started to run, in  order to replay the ball. He stepped under the net,  without touching the opponent's court and the net,  but due to an opponent player still within his own  court also moving towards the ball, he was not able  to replay the ball. Has the player of team B been  interfered by the team A player?   
Ruling   Each player has the right to stand and move freely in  his own court and playing space. There are some  limitations  to  play  in  opponent’s  court  or  playing  space or in the free zone. Therefore, to decide about  the eventual interference it is a crucial point, if the  player of team A was within his own court or in the  free zone.   If he moved within his own court, his play was legal.  On the other hand if he was in the free zone and his  movement was on purpose, it can be considered as an interference, he  committed a fault.   Rule 10.1.2.2   3.13.2    VIDEO   The ball rebounded from the blocker of team A, before hitting the antenna and the side band on team B’s side, then it landed on the court.  The 1st referee decided that the action was a successful block and the next serving team was to be team A.Was it a correct decision?   
Ruling     No, decision is not correct. As shown on the video, the ball touches to the antenna and side band at the same time and changes it’s direction on the team B side . “Referees signal the end of the rally, provided that they are sure that a fault has been committed and they have identified its nature” (Rule 22.2.1.2).  They must refrain from deciding solely upon their assumptions, as shown on the accompanying video.   They must refrain from deciding upon their assumptions.  In this case as shown on the video as well:

  In cases: a. lf the ball touches to the antenna, the ball becomes out (Rule 8.4.3) Referees must whistle and give the hand signal ball “out”. b. If the ball contacts only to the side band, referees may not stop the game, this is not a fault. c. lf the ball touches to the side band and antenna at the same time. Most of the times it changes its direction. Since the contact of the ball to the antenna is a fault, referees must whistle and display ball “out” hand signal.      Rules 22.2.1, 8.4.3                 
3.13.3 NEW    VIDEO  The ball hit the tape but not the antenna. Should the rebound from the tape automatically be judged to have hit the antenna?  
Ruling   No, the referees must actually see the ball hit the antenna. Many forces come into play when the ball rebounds so referees should not automatically assume that a fault has occurred.     Rules 22.2.1, 8.4.3 Rules 8.4.1, 8.4.2, 9.1,  10.1.2, 10.1.2.1, 10.1.2.2   3.13.4 NEW      VIDEO  After a poor team hit, the setter ran after the ball and played it in the opponent free zone.  What should the referees consider in the action?  
Ruling   Good optical position should inform the referees if the ball passed to the opponent free zone inside the crossing space. If this occurred, then as soon as the ball is played by the setter, it becomes a fault and must be whistled. However, if the ball passed over or outside the antenna, the contact by the setter is legal, and if the ball travels back to his own side over or outside the antenna, it may be legally attacked.    Ruling    Yes. This is interference.   Interference means a player stops an opponent from  moving,  or  playing  the  ball,  or  disturbing  the  opponent while attempting to play the ball.   Rules 11.2.1, 11.2.2.1, 11.2.4    Ruling   No. Many circumstantial contacts actually occur in a match - but the referee should whistle a player if  he/she  interfered  with or  stopped the opponent’s ability to play.   Rule 11.2.1   3.16    VIDEO    During a spectacular dig a player penetrates into the  opponent’s court so, that his body hits the floor, but  both legs are completely in the air over the opponent  court with no part above the center line. There was  no interference with the opponent players. Was it a  faulty action?   
Ruling   No. By the Rule 11.2.2 it is also permitted to touch the  opponent’s court with any part of the body  above  the  foot (feet) provided there is no  interference with the opponent’s play.   Since the feet did not touch the opponent’s court and  there was no interference with the opponent’s play,  the situation cannot be considered as a fault.   Rule 11.2.2   
3.14   A spiker landed with his heels on the center line, but   with most of his feet on the feet of the opponent’s   blocker     preventing     his      ability      to      move.   Is this interference?   
3.15   Is physical contact always interference?

 3.17    VIDEO Looking carefully at the blue player’s movement, it is clear that he makes a fault by standing on the opponent court and side line, having initially believed that he can retrieve the ball. The opponent had to take urgent and evasive action to get out of the way. Is this interference? 
 
  Ruling The first fault is that the blue player’s foot was on the opponent court and side line. Had this not been the case, the definition of interference is preventing a player from making a play on the ball. By making the opponent take such evasive action, this can be judged as interference.   Refereeing Guidelines & Instructions Rule 7 item 5,  Rule: 7.5,  3.18  NEW  VIDEO   The player chased the ball passing partly outside the crossing space to the opponent free zone. In so doing her complete foot was in contact with the opponent side line. Should the 1st referee have whistled this as a fault?  
Ruling   Yes, this is a fault. The side line is inside the opponent’s court dimensions.  Had the whole foot contact with the side line been simultaneous contact with the center line by that foot (or if part of the foot had been over the center line), it would not have been a fault.   Rules 11.2.2.1    3.19   VIDEO   After a simultaneous contact above the plane of the  net, the ball landed outside the court of team A.  Who gets next service?    
Ruling   If  the  contact  is truly  simultaneous  by  opponents  exactly above the net, where both players have the  right to play the ball and it lands outside a court, it is  the fault of the team on the opposite side. Team A  gets service.   Rules 9.1.2.2, 9.1.2.3   
3.20   An attack hit drove the net into the blocker’s  forearms. Is this a net fault?   Ruling   No. If the net hits the player, there is no fault.   Rules 11.3.1, 11.4.4   3.21 After a blocker landed securely, he turned and hit the  mesh  of  the  net  between  the  antennae  with  his  shoulder.   Should this have been called a fault?   
Ruling   No.  Because  the  action  of  playing  the  ball  was  complete before he turned, the contact with the net  is not a fault.   Rules 11.3.1, 11.4.4   3.22    VIDEO   While attempting to block, but without touching the  ball, which was close to him, the blocker touched the  net.   Is this a fault?   
Ruling   Yes  –  since  this  is  “in  the  action”  of  playing  or  attempting to play the ball, even though no contact  was made.   Rules 11.3.1, 11.4.4   3.23   A middle blocker reached over the net and touched  its top band while attempting to stop a combination  play close to him.   Is this a fault?   
Ruling   Yes – the touch of the net was indeed a “net fault”:  the blocker was close to the action, and the contact  was between the antennae.   Rules 11.3.1, 11.4.4

3.24    VIDEO   An attacker landed securely on the floor then took  two steps and brushed against the net outside of the  antenna while the ball was still in play.   Is this a fault?   
Ruling   No the player did not commit a fault because:   First:   -   the contact was outside the antenna      Then:   -   he/she did not use the net as support or   stabilizing aid   Rules 11.3.1, 11.3.2, 11.4.4   
3.25  An attacker landed on the floor off balance, took two  steps  and  pushed  with  his  chest  against  the  net  between the antennae while the ball was still in play.  If the player had not caught the net, he would  have fallen onto the opponent’s court.   Is this a fault?   
Ruling   Yes,  if  a  the player  is  using  the  net  as  a  support  or  stabilizing aid, between the antennae, his action  is considered as interference with the play.   Rules 11.3.1, 11.4.4   
3.26  A setter made a short set and when the attacker hit  the ball, he/she also hit the setter with his/her knee.  This hit caused the setter to brush against the net.   Is this a fault?   
Ruling   Yes, because the setter was in the action of playing the ball.   Rules 11.3.1, 11.4.4   
3.27.     VIDEO   A player hit the net with her hair while playing the  ball. Was her action legal?   Ruling   Yes. This must only be considered a fault if it is clear,  that the net touch affected the opponent’s ability to  play the ball or it interrupted the rally (e.g. a pony-  tail  gets  tangled  in  the  net).  If  there  was  no  interference either on the opponent’s play, or on the  rally, the referees must not stop the game.   Rules 11.3.1, 11.4.4

3.27.1    VIDEO 1      VIDEO 2 In the first case, an attacker after spiking the ball hit the blocker’s  hand  which  had  reached  over  the  net  plane  and  drove it to touch the top band of the net.   In case, both the attacker and blocker make contact with the ball. However, the attacker follows through and contacts the arm of the blocker, forcing it on to the net band.   Could it be judged as a net fault or interference during these two game actions?        
 
 
 
Ruling   In first case, the blocker’s net touch cannot be considered as a  faulty one, because his action was modified by the  attacker. However if the 1st referee realizes that the attacker  drove  the  opponent’s  hand  into  the  net  with  a  deliberate movement, the attacker made a fault by  interfering with the opponent’s play, which is not  according to the spirit of FAIR PLAY. Therefore the  attacker’s action should be penalized, considered as  rude conduct, with the application of the appropriate  misconduct sanction.                                                                                                           In second case, it is not interference. Interference involves preventing an opponent making a play on the ball. Here the ball has already been played by the blocker – so no interference. Many incidental or accidental contacts are made between opponents anyway, and these are not automatically faults. This is clearly one of those instances, and the referees must be prepared to assess this as a “no fault” situation by either player. Play should continue.  Of course, if the action by the spiker was clearly a deliberate attempt to make the opponent contact the net or misguide the referees, this would be subject to misconduct sanctions.                                                Refereeing Guidelines 2024    3.27.2.    VIDEO   A player participating in a collective block already  finished the blocking action and landed. However,  the “blocking-mate” player during the landing fell  down on the previous player and drove her into the  net between the antennae. Can this net touch be  considered as a faulty one?   
Ruling   Yes.  The players of a collective block are counted as a  “unit”. If one of them is still in the action of playing  the ball, it means the entire unit is in the action.  Therefore  the  other  player’s  net touch should  be  considered as a fault.   Rules 11.3.1   
3.27.3    VIDEO   Is  it  allowed  for  a  player  to  penetrate  into  the  opponent’s space under the net when although there  is no physical contact with the opponent player, the  opponent is shocked by it? 
Ruling It is allowed provided, that the opponent player is not   interfered with, preventing him playing the ball. Interference may occur even if there is no physical   contact between the players. The 1st referee has the   right  to  stop  the  game  due  to  the  fault  of  the   penetrating player and if necessary, to warn/sanction   him.   Rules 11.2.1

It  wouldn’t  be  a  fault,  if  the  ball  hits  the  player  through  the  net  in  a  situation,  where  the  player  standing  close  to  the  net  is  in  a  passive/neutral  position without any movement towards the ball OR  protect his/her face/body against a strongly spiked  ball.   But if the player moves towards the ball, „chasing” it   and deliberately hits it and changing the direction  and/or the speed of the rebounding ball, it is not  allowed.   Rule 11.4.4   
3.28  As soon as a player had hit the ball for service, the  scorer signaled “wrong server” or rotational fault to  the 2nd referee, who stopped the game. Is this the  correct action by the scorer?   
Ruling   Correct action by the scorer. When a wrong server is  ready to serve the ball, the scorer must wait until the  service action has been completed before notifying  the referees of the fault.   Rules 7.7.1, 12.2.1, 12.7.1, 27.2.2.2   3.29  After  the  whistle  for  service,  the  serving  team  recognized  it  was  the  wrong  server.  The  correct  server then entered the service zone ready to serve.  Can this player now serve?   
Ruling   Yes – provided the service is made by the correct  player within 8 seconds from the whistle for service.  The 1st referee does not whistle a second time.   Rule 12.4.4    Ruling   Yes – the 1st referee must whistle immediately it is  clear  the  ball  will  not  cross  the  net  through  the  crossing space. At this moment the ball is out of play.  The 1st referee must not wait until the ball hits the  floor or a player of the serving team.   Rule 12.6.2.1   
3.31    VIDEO  Is this allowed to execute the jump service hitting the  ball with 2 hands?   Ruling   No, the rule determines, that during the service, no  matter jump or on floor, the ball should be hit with  one hand/arm, therefore to hit the ball with 2 hands  is forbidden and faulty.   Rule 12.4.1, 12.6.1.2   
3.27.4     VIDEO  After a weak service reception of team B the ball   went into net close to the sideband. A player of the   team A in position 2 did a clear sideway movement   towards the ball, hit it with high elevated forearms   through the net. The opponent player was not able   to play the ball due to the different rebounding from   the net. The 1st referee whistled net fault by the   player of team A. Was it a correct decision?    
Ruling Yes, it was a correct decision.   
3.30  Team ‘A’ served. The ball hit the net and dropped   towards the floor on ‘A’’s side of the net. A player of   ‘B’ reached under the net and caught the ball before   it hit the floor.   Is this allowed?

3.32  A back row setter jumped from within the front zone  and set the ball while it was completely above the  height of the net, directing it towards an attacker.  Before  the  attacker  could  contact  the  ball,  it  penetrated the vertical plane of the net where it was  blocked by the opponent’s setter. Was there a fault?   
Ruling   Yes. The set became an illegal attack hit by a back row  player when the attack hit was completed (in this  case by contacting the opponent’s block). The rally is  won by the blocking team.   Rule 13.1.3   3.33    VIDEO  On a second hit, a player passed the ball near the net  towards  the  opponent’s  court.  In  the  1streferee’s   evaluation, no player of ‘A’ could possibly reach the ball.  The blocker of ‘B’ reached across the plane of the net  and blocked the ball. What is the correct decision of  the 1st referee?   
Ruling   Yes, it was. Even though it was only the second team hit, if the  ball  is  moving  in  the  direction  of  the  opponent’s  court, it is an attack hit. Because, in the referee’s evaluation, no player of ‘A’ could possibly have reached  and was willing to play the ball, the block of ‘B’ was  legal.   Rules 13.1.1, 14.3, Guidelines 14.1   3.34 A back row player took off in the front zone and as a  second hit spiked the ball which was completely  higher than the top of the net. The ball rebounded  from the net band and did not cross to the   opponent. Is this a fault?   
Ruling   No. Since the ball neither crossed the plane of the net  nor was contacted by the blocker, the attack hit was  not completed.   The rally continues.   Rules 9.1, 13.1.3, 13.2.2, 13.3.3   3.35    ‘A’s’ receiver jumped from behind the attack line and  contacted the served ball from completely higher  than the top of the net. The contact was behind the  attack line and the ball returned to the serving   team's side of the net.   Should play continue?   
Ruling   Yes, because it was a legal action. Although it is illegal  to block or to complete an attack hit on the service from  completely above the height of the net over the front  zone, the attack was legal since the contact point of  the hit was completely behind the attack line.   
Rules 13.3.4, 19.3.1.3   
3.36   ‘A’ passed badly and the ball crossed the plane of the  net. The middle blocker of ‘B’ hit the ball across the  net against the raised arm of the back row setter  from ‘A’, who was still close to the net and above the  height of the net. The ball then rebounded across the  net into ‘B’s’ court.   Who committed the fault?   
Ruling   The setter’s "block" was illegal because he/she was a  back row player. Intercepting a ball from opponent  close to the net is a block if a part of the body is above  net height.   
Rules 14.1.1, 14.1.3, 14.6.2   3.37 NEW When the ball was completely above the court of team A, it was attacked by the team A player in position 2. Simultaneous with this, the opponent blocker also contacted the ball. Is this a blocking fault?    
Ruling This is not a fault of either player. It would be a fault if the blocker had contacted the ball first, but blocking simultaneously is NOT a fault.                                                Rule 14.3

3.38   Is it legal for a blocker to reach over the net to block  an opponent’s “setting” action?   Ruling   No, it is not legal. It is a fault to block a set. However, it is absolutely  necessary for the 1streferee to determine the action  of the setter. He/she must know whether the set was       made parallel to the net (block fault) or       was going towards the net, thus making it an   attack  hit  (no  fault,  if  there  is  no  setter’s  teammate close to the ball and willing to play it).   Rules 14.1.1, 14.3   3.39  A player of ‘A’ blocked the attack of ‘B’. Then the  middle blocker of ‘B’ blocked the block of ‘A’.   Is it legal to block a blocked ball?   
Ruling   Yes, to block is to intercept a ball coming from the  opponent, thus  it  is  legal  to  block  an  opponent’s  block.   Rule 14.1.1   3.40  A ball blocked by the legally penetrating blocker of  team B flew some meters parallel to the net before a  second player of B hit the ball with a blocking action  down to the floor on the side of team ‘A’. The ball had  never penetrated into the air space of ’B’. Who gets  next service?   
Ruling   Team  A.  The  second  player’s  action  cannot  be  considered as block, because the ball was coming  from the block of his/her teammate.   Thus, he/she was attacking in the opponent’s space -  which is a fault according to the rules.   Rules 11.1.2, 14.1.1, 14.2, 14.3   3.41   Can  an  attacker  hit  the  ball  coming  from  the  reception of his/her teammate with both hands using  a blocking action, directing the ball to the other side  of the net?   
Ruling   Yes, he can. It is a legal play, provided it is not a double contact or  a catch or throw.   The contact must be on the player’s own side of the  net, however – not on the opponent’s.    Ruling   Provided  it  is  a  blocking  action  and  not  separate  actions, this is considered as block touch. After the  block, a team is allowed three more ball contacts.      Rules 9.1, 9.2.3.2, 14.2, 14.4.1    Ruling    Double fault and therefore replay.   The attack hit by the back row player was illegal. The  simultaneous block by the back row player was also illegal.         Rules 13.3.3, 14.1.1, 14.6.2   
3.44    A  back  row  player  is  separate  in  distance  from  a  collective block and lower than the top of the net –  but is hit by the ball. Is this an illegal block?   
Ruling   No. The player was not part of the collective block  and was not higher than the top of the net when the  ball contacted him/her.   This contact  is considered as a first team hit.   Rules 9.3.1, 14.1.1   
3.42 The ball made multiple contacts with the head and   hands of several blockers.   Should this be permitted?    3.43  Back row player’s illegal attack versus illegal block (i.e simultaneous contact by back row player) in the attacker’s team space.   What is the fault?

3.45   The contact with the ball by a blocker was lower than  the top of the net, although part of his/her hand was  above the net. Is this a block?   
Ruling   Yes – having part of the body above the net is critical;  the team would, therefore, have three more hits.   Rules 9.1, 14.1.1, 14.4.1   
3.46    A blocker hit the ball when he had already come  down from his jump and his whole body was lower  than the top of the net. When he hit the ball again,  the referee called a “double hit”.   Was this correct?   
Ruling   The decision was correct. At the moment of the ball  contact, no part of the body of the blocker was higher  than the top of the net. So the action could not be  considered as a block, but the first contact of the  team and his later contact made this a double hit.   Rules 9.1, 14.1.1, 14.4.1   
3.47     Illegal attack hit by back row player versus attempted  Libero block- which occurs first?   Ruling   The attack hit becomes a mistake at the moment  when the ball has crossed the net totally or the block  touched it. The attempt of the Libero to block was an  action  before  the  completion  of  the  opponent’s  attack hit and is therefore the first mistake.   Rule 19.3.1.3   
3.48      VIDEO    A player of the team A attacked the ball, which was  blocked by the blocker of team B. After the block hit,  the ball crossed the lower space (i.e. under the net)  and landed on the court of the team B. Which team  won the rally?   
Ruling:   It should be considered as a perfect block, the rally  has been won by the team B.   
3.49    VIDEO     An attacker spiked the ball OUT, but the blocker’s   pony tail hit the ball. The hit was proved by the video  challenge footage. The 1st referee decided „touched  ball” and the next service to the attacking team. Was  this decision correct?      
Ruling:   No.   The net touch by hair is not considered as a fault,  unless this net touch has influence on the game.  Keeping consistency to this approach, the touch by  blocker’s hair is not counted as a touch neither. The rally would have to be won by the defending team.   
3.50    VIDEO   During a block, the player was seen to catch and throw down the ball. Is such an action allowed?   
Ruling:   Volleyball is a rebound sport. Any catch and throw is a fault.  The ball may only be redirected towards the floor. This action in the video should be called as a fault by the 1st referee.           Rule 9.2.2 

--- Page 24 ---
                                                  Casebook 2024             Page 23/55 
3.51    VIDEO    The ball rebounded high from the opponent block of  the team A, then returned to the opponent space.  There a player close to the net, reaching over the top  of the net, hit/block the ball, which rebounded from the top  band and the same player hit it again. Is this a legal  play? 
Ruling:   Yes, the 1st referee made a good decision for allowing  the rally continue.   If a player, close to the net and reaching over the top  of the net, intercepts the ball coming from the opponent,  the action might be either block or attack hit. During  the judgment, the position of the player’s hand(s) or  other part of body should be counted, but the height  of the ball is irrelevant.   The  player’s  hit  is  considered  as  a  “block”,  if  the  player stretches reaching over the net to intercept  the ball with one or two hands without a classical  spiking/backswing movement (refer case 3.54).   Based  on  the  above  interpretation  the  situation  illustrated by the video should be considered as a   legal blocking action.   
3.52    VIDEO     A ball was blocked straight down. Before the ball  landed on the opponent’s floor, the ball touched the  leg of the middle blocker, who was already standing  on the floor without the intention of kicking the ball.  If there was no leg hit, the ball would have landed  clearly on the floor on team B’s side.   Can the middle blocker’s leg touch be considered as  an interference to the opponent’s play?   
Ruling   No.   Because the middle blocker’s leg touch was  unintentional and he already stood on the floor, he  made no mistake.   However if the contact was well above the floor, and  there was an opponent player with a potential play  on the ball, then this is interference.   
3.53    VIDEO A back row setter facing towards his own end line  jumped close to the net when the attacked ball  from the opponent hit his head. Can this action be  considered as an illegal block?   
Ruling:   No. To consider that an action is a block 3 conditions  should be fulfilled simultaneously:   - the player is close to the net   - the ball is coming from the opponent   - the player has some part of his body projecting   above the top of the net.   It is not relevant which direction the player is facing.   If the referee judges that the 3 conditions have been  fulfilled, the action was a block.

3.54    VIDEO     A player of team B sent the ball slightly to the   opponent. A player of team A close to the net,  reaching over the top of the net, hit the ball, which   rebounded from the top band and the same player  hits it again. Had the 1st referee a good decision  allowing the rally to continue?   
Ruling:   No.   The situation is similar, but still different to the case  3.51.   If a player, close to the net and reaching over the top  of the net, hits the ball coming from the opponent,  the action is an attack hit. During  the judgment, the position of the player’s hand(s) or  other part of body should be counted, but the height  of the ball is irrelevant.   The player’s hit is considered as an attack, i.e. first  team  hit,  if  the  player  uses  a  classical  spiking/backswing movement of the arm as on video  shown, then hits the ball directing it towards the  opponent.   Therefore, if the player for this first hit executes an  attack “spike”, then hits again the ball rebounding  from the net, he/ she commits a “double hit” fault.  Based on the above interpretation the situation   illustrated by the video should be considered as a  “double hit”, faulty action. The rally should  immediately be stopped and won by team B.

    SUBSTITUTIONS   
  CHAPTER 4 - INTERRUPTIONS AND DELAYS  
                                      4.4 NEW Team A attempted to make a substitution, but this was rejected, because the incoming player was not ready to play. As a consequence, the team was issued with a delay warning. The next rally started but was interrupted when an errant ball entered the court. Team A immediately tried to make the same substitution before play restarted. The referees refused to accept the substitution. Were they correct to do so?  
Ruling  Yes, the referees were correct. The team may not make another request for a regular game interruption (substitution or time out) until the interrupted rally is completed – i.e. until a point is awarded. Rule 15.2   
 Casebook 2024  Page 25/55 
 Ruling   This is legal as long as this does not cause a delay.  Therefore,  the  2nd  referee  simply  carries  out  one  substitution.   The  scorer  is  responsible  for  recording  only  substitutions  which  actually  take  place.  In  such  a  case,  the  2nd  referee  should  carefully  check  how  many substitutions were recorded in the score sheet,  regardless of whether a paper or an electronic one is  used. Rules 15.10.2, 15.10.3.1, 15.10.4, 16.1   4.2  One substitute player entered the substitution zone  (the scorer sounded the horn) while another one was  just leaving the warm-up area to try to enter the  substitution zone.   How many substitutions should be allowed?   
Ruling   The moment of the request is the entrance of the  substitute player(s) into the substitution zone. In this  case the 2nd referee should grant only the one for the  player who actually entered the substitution zone.  The second action should be rejected as not a part of  the original request. However, in such a situation the  2nd referee has the right to wave away the player  trying to enter the substitution in order to prevent an  improper request. This is part of “smooth refereeing” Rules 15.10.3.1, 15.10.3.2, 15.11.1.3   
4.3         VIDEO   A rally had to be interrupted due to the injury of a  player of team A. After a short therapy on court the  injured player was judged ready to play. Before the  whistle  for  the  next  service,  team  A  requested  a  substitution. Is it allowed?   
Ruling   No, it is not allowed. If a rally has been interrupted due to an injury, or an  external interference, for example a ball rolling onto  the  court,  the  net  has  been  broken,  failure  of  electricity, etc., it is improper to request any regular  game interruption, except a forced substitution for  an injured or sanctioned player, including an exceptional substitution for these reasons.   Refereeing Guidelines Rule 6 and 15.7   
4.1    VIDEO   Two  substitute  players  entered  the  substitution   zone.  After  the  request  was  recognized  and   acknowledged by the scorer, the coach decided to   make only one substitution.   What is the procedure for the 2nd referee?   

--- Page 27 ---
                                  4.8 NEW      VIDEO In a competition where full technology was operating, substitution paddles were not used. Is this correct procedure?  
Ruling Yes. The paddles permit only limited player shirt numbers, while in FIVB, World and Official Competitions for Seniors extended numbers are used within the roster. In addition, the bench tablets allow the teams to transmit the numbers of the substituting players in advance. Hence, in those competitions paddles are not required. Rule 15.10.3.1         Casebook 2024  Page 26/55 
4.5   The substitute player had entered the substitution  zone with the wrong “numbered paddle” (e.g. own  paddle) for substitution. He fumbled to get the   correct one. The 1st  referee awarded a delay  sanction, but allowed the substitution. Is this the correct response by the 1st referee?   
Ruling Not  correct.  In  competitions  where  numbered  paddles are in use, the substitute player must enter  the substitution zone with the correct paddle.   Otherwise this causes confusion for the scorer, the team  and the public – and will likely create a delay. Thus,  the request for substitution by the team must be  rejected, and a delay sanction must be awarded. Rules 15.10.3.1, 16.1.1, 16.2   4.6    If a substitute steps into the substitution zone just as  the whistle sounds for service, should the 2nd referee  permit the substitution?   
Ruling   No. The substitution should not be permitted. Generally,  this  situation  is  a  typical  case  of  an  improper  request:  reject  and  allow  the  game  to  continue if the game has not been stopped and it was  the first improper request for this team.   However, if the game has been stopped due to this  request it should be considered as a delay and a sanction for delay will  result.   The same delay sanction should be applied if it was a  repeated improper request by this team - which is  considered as delay.   Rules 15.10.3.1, 15.11.1.1, 15.11.3, 16.2   
4.7     Player #8 entered the substitution zone with paddle  #10. The coach insisted on the substitution with #9.  After a short discussion, the 2nd referee rejected the  substitution and the team was sanctioned with a delay  warning.   Was the decision correct?   
Ruling   The decision was correct. The substitution of #8 and  #10  would  have  been  legal.  However,  the  coach  insisted on the substitution of #8 for #9. Because the  wrong paddle was shown and this caused a delay, the  referee correctly sanctioned the team for delay.  Substitution should be rejected.   Rules 16.1.1, 16.2   
 Ruling     Yes, the decision was correct.   The  first  player  had  to  be  substituted  by  an  exceptional substitution due to injury. The team still  had the right to REQUEST a substitution in the same  interruption.   Rule 15.7   
4.9   A player became injured and had to be substituted   exceptionally. During the same game interruption,   the team requested an additional substitution. The   2nd referee accepted the request.   Was the 2nd referee’s decision correct to accept the   request?    
--- Page 28 ---
          4.11  NEW   An expelled player could not be replaced by a legal substitution. What options has the coach in this case?   
Ruling This rule was established to permit the match to continue, if possible, rather than ending it prematurely, and disappointing the spectators.   The coach has two possibilities here:  1. to carry out an exceptional substitution with the expelled player or  2. surrendering the set to the opponent because the team is “incomplete”.  If the option 1 is chosen, the expelled player (who could normally return in the next set) is forbidden to re-enter the match. But the set continues.  If the option 2 is chosen, the team loses the set in progress but the expelled player can return in the next set. Rule 15.8                          Casebook 2024  Page 27/55  
4.10     Player  #6  of  team  ‘A’  was  disqualified  from  the  match, and legally substituted by #7. This was the  first  substitution  for  team  ‘A’  during the  set,  and  there were three more players on the bench. During  the next rally, team ‘A’ player #7 became injured and  was not able to continue to play.   How should the game be continued?   
Ruling:   Since the injured player #7 cannot be substituted  legally,  he/she should be  substituted exceptionally. 
Rules 15.7,15.8   
4.12    A  player  listed  on  the  line-up  sheet  was  injured  before the start of the match. Can he be substituted  before the match?   
Ruling   Yes – but it should be shown formally by substitution  signal  (coach  and  2nd  referee  so  that  everyone  understands the situation) and must be recorded on  the score sheet as a regular substitution. Nevertheless, in certain top-level competitions, special regulations could be applied allowing the player being replaced in the line-up without counting as a regular substitution. In this case, this regulation will be included in the Specific Competition Regulations in the Playbook. Rules 7.3.2, 7.3.4   4.13       Player #7 of team ‘A’ was found to be on the court  when he should have been on the bench. Team ‘A’  had used the allowable six team substitutions. Since  there were no legal substitutions remaining, what  was the proper procedure to be used by the officials?   
Ruling   Since team ‘A’ had an incorrect line-up, which was  caused by an illegal substitution, the procedure given  in Rule 15.9.2 should be the following:   a.  Point and service for team ‘B’.   b.  The substitution must be rectified. #7 has to be   removed  from  the  set  and  the  correct  player  must return to the court. This correction does not  count as regular substitution.   c.  All points scored by team ‘A’ while #7 was in the  game illegally must be cancelled, but the score of  the opponent’s team will remain as it is.   d.  There is no further penalty for team ‘A’.   Rule 15.9.2

                                                   Casebook 2024  Page 28/55 
4.14       After  team  ‘B’  had  used  five  substitutions,  two  substitute  players  entered  the  substitution  zone.  What is the proper response of the 2nd referee?   
Ruling   The 2nd referee has to remind the coach that only one  substitution will be possible and ask the coach which  one will be made.   Provided there is no delay, the other substitution will  be rejected as an improper request which is marked  in the score sheet.   Rules 15.5, 15.6, 15.11, 16.1   4.15      A team requested two substitutions. When checking  the substitutions, the scorer indicated that one of the  requests  for  substitution  was  legal  and  the  other  request  for  substitution  was  illegal.  What  is  the  proper response of the 2nd referee?   
Ruling   The 2nd referee allows the legal substitution to take  place. The illegal substitution must be refused no  matter  in  which  order  the  substitute  players  approach the side line.   The  request  for  an  illegal  substitution  must  be  sanctioned with a “delay sanction”.   Rules 15.6, 16.1.3   4.16       A team was refused a requested substitution by the   scorer pressing the buzzer a second time. When the   2ndreferee checked the score sheet, she discovered  that the substitution was, in fact, “legal”, and “re-   corrected”  the  situation.  This  was  quite   embarrassing. What should have been the correct   response of the 2ndreferee?   
Ruling   The procedure of the 2ndreferee was correct. If the referees realizes that one of them made a mistake, this mistake must be corrected, and the decision changed even if this causes an unfavorable impression about the referee team.                 4.17      A substitute player was standing in the substitution  zone, ready to enter. However, the player on court  initially refused to leave the court. Is this delay?  Should the substitution be refused?   
Ruling   Yes, it is delay.   However,  the  substitution  THIS  TIME  should  be  allowed, because the request was legal according to  the rules and the player in play caused this special  case, and the substitute player did not cause the  delay.   Rules 16.1.1, 23.2.3   
4.18        If a player in the line-up sheet does not match with the players on the court  what does the 2nd referee do?   
Ruling   The 2nd referee should show the line-up sheet to the  coach and ask what he wants to do. If the coach  wishes to keep what is on court, he needs to make  a legal substitution at 0:0. This is one of the situations,  where the coach must give the hand signal to avoid  misunderstandings.   The 2nd referee also must carry out this formally for  public, statistics, etc. understanding of the situation.   Rules 7.3.5.2, 7.3.5.3   

--- Page 30 ---
                                                         Casebook 2024  Page 29/55 
4.19      Player #6, ready to play, entered the substitution  zone  during  an  interruption.  The  scorer  acknowledged the request by using the buzzer. At  that moment the coach changed his/her mind and  ordered the player back into the warm-up area.  Should the substitution have been applied and what  should have been the correct procedure?   
Ruling   The request for substitution was correct and already  acknowledged by the scorer in using the buzzer. Due  to  the  request,  the  game  was  stopped.  It  is  not  obligatory  to  apply  the  substitution,  but  the  procedure caused a delay and should be sanctioned.   Rules 15.10.3.1, 15.10.3.3, 16.1.1   
4.20      VIDEO        After  the  whistle  for  service,  a  substitute  player  entered the substitution zone. The scorer ignored  this, and the game didn’t stop. After the end of the  rally  the  2nd  referee  told  the  scorer  to  record  an  improper request in the score sheet. Was this the  right procedure?   
Ruling   The 2nd referee was correct. This was a typical case of  an improper request, which had to be recorded in the  score sheet. The 2nd referee should aware this to the coach. If this was a repeated improper request, a delay sanction must have been issued.                Rules 15.11.1.1, 15.11.2, 16.1.1   
4.21      If  a  scorer  presses  the  buzzer  for  substitution  by  mistake (after the whistle for service/ player doesn’t  enter  the  substitution  zone),  should  the  team  be  charged with an improper request?   
Ruling   No, since the fault is made by the scorer, this should  not be considered either as improper request or as a  delay.             Rules 15.10.3.1, 15.10.3.3    4.22         An unregistered player was found to be on court.  What do the officials do?   Ruling   The coach and the team captain have the duty to  control the registration of players and confirm it with  their signature.  Unregistered players who have played in the match  will be removed from the court as soon as this is  discovered, in favor of a  legitimate  registered  player. All points  scored  while  this  unregistered  player  was  on  court  will  be  cancelled,  and  the  opponents will gain a point and the next service.  If the mistake is detected after the end of the set, the  set would be lost by the team at fault. If the mistake  is discovered after the end of the match, the whole  match would be lost due to the unregistered player  in the match. To avoid this kind of situation, before each set the 2nd referee and the scorer must check if the players’ numbers listed on the line-up sheet correspond to the players’ numbers listed on the scoresheet.   Rules 4.1.3, 4.2.2, 5.1.1, 5.2.2, 7.3.5.4, 15.9.2   
4.23     During an interruption, the receiving team ‘A’   requested  a  substitution. During  this  interruption,  team ‘B’ was penalized, which caused team ‘A’ to  rotate one position. After this, team ‘A’ requested a  new substitution. Is this possible?   
Ruling   Yes. Because there was in fact a completed rally (as  defined in the rules) between the two requests for  substitution.    Rules 6.1.3, 15.2.3

4.24        At the control of the line-up, the 2nd referee detected  that the number of the Libero was in the starting line-  up.  He asked the coach to correct the line-up sheet  and informed the scorer about it. After this, the match  started. Was the procedure correct?      
Ruling   Yes, the procedure was correct. In this case, the 2nd referee should ask the coach for  a  new  and  correct  line-up  sheet  (which  can  be  changed only in the position, where the Libero was  recorded by mistake).  Once the corrected line up  sheet has been checked against the line up on  court, the 2nd referee will allow the Libero to enter  the court.   Rule 7.3.5.2   
4.25     VIDEO   A team requests a substitution, which is not granted  because  of  a  wrong  paddle.  This  action  caused  a  delay penalty, because the team had already had a  delay warning.  Can  the  team  make  a  new  request  for  substitution?   
Ruling   Yes. As penalties are considered as  complete rallies, the new request can be accepted  in this case.                Rule 6.1.3 – 15.2.3   
4.26      VIDEO   A team wished to apply a double substitution. One  player entered the substitution zone ready to play;  meanwhile, the other player was still looking for the  numbered  paddle.  Before  the  finishing  of  administrative  duties  for  the  first  substitution,  he  was  already  in  place.  Was  the  procedure  of  the  referees correct to allow both substitutions without  intervention?   
Ruling   Yes. The referees applied well the procedure of  the multiple substitutions. If there is no real delay,  the referees should be flexible.   This case is different to 4.2 above where the second player to enter was too far away from the substitution zone. Refereeing Guidelines and Instructions   
 Ruling   No. A substitute player should be ready to play in the  moment  of  the  request  for  substitution.  A  player  wearing a warming up shirt cannot be considered  being ready to play; therefore, this request has to be  denied and a delay sanction is to be issued.   Rules 15.10.3.1, 15.10.3.2   
4.27 NEW   Time out duration is set at 30 seconds. Can this be adjusted?  Ruling Yes. The duration of time outs can be adjusted according to the needs of the competition. If using e-score, the clock can be set accordingly.  Rule 15.4.1 
4.28      VIDEO   Can a team request a substitution before AND after a  time out, all taking place in the same interruption in  play?   
Ruling   No – while two Time outs can be called by the same  team in  the  same  interruption,  two  successive  substitution  requests  are  NOT  allowed  and  the  second one should be considered as an improper  request.   Rules 15.3.1, 15.3.2, 15.10.3.1,  15.11.1.3, 27.2.2.6   
4.26.1     VIDEO   A  substitute  player  wearing  a  warming  up  shirt   entered  the  substitution  zone  with  a  numbered   paddle.  During  the  exchange  on  the  side  line,  he   reaIized this, pulled off the shirt and gave it to the   player leaving the court. Is it a legal procedure for a   substitution?

4.29    VIDEO   A coach made a third request for time-out, which was  granted  by  the  2nd  referee.  At that moment the  scorer realized that it was the third time-out for this  team and notified the 2nd referee about this.   What is the proper procedure for the officials?   
Ruling   Normally this is an improper request – but here an  actual  delay  occurred. So reject or immediately  curtail  the  time-out.  Players  return  to  court. The  Game Captain is informed of the actual delay and   a delay sanction is applied.   Rules 15.11.1.4, 16.1.5, 27.2.2.6   4.30   Is it possible to have an improper request AFTER the  team has already been awarded a DELAY warning or  penalty?   
Ruling   Yes, it is. While unusual, a delay can be followed by  an improper request – it is not an escalation of the  delay!   The rule regarding improper requests and the rule for  delay are both quite specific in what constitutes an  improper request/ what constitutes a delay. So that,  even if the team has already been sanctioned for delay,  some actions are ONLY improper requests and are  not combined within the earlier delay.   Rule 15.5, 16.1   4.30.1   Is it allowed to request a Time-out or “normal” player  substitution, if a request for game interruption has  already been rejected and sanctioned with a delay  warning?   
Ruling   No.    In such a situation the team has  to wait until the end of the next completed rally for  the next request for game interruption.   If the team still makes a request, it should not be  considered as an improper request, just the team  should be reminded of this.       Rule 15.2.4, Refereeing Guidelines and Instructions   
4.31   VIDEO   Can a player play with a nose bleed?   Ruling   No. Referees must use discretion if an injury occurs in  which  a  player  bleeds.  If  an  immediate  medical  treatment does not rectify the injury, he/she must be  substituted or replaced until the bleeding is stopped  and the blood is removed from the player’s uniform.  A substitute player must be permitted a reasonable  time to take off his/her training suit and enter the  game.   It is an acceptable procedure by the 1st referee to give  neither a delay sanction nor to ask the team for a  game interruption.    Rules 4.4, 15.5, 15.10.2, 15.10.3.1, 17.1.1

4.32     VIDEO   A Libero injured his hand while playing defense. After  a short therapy, the Libero declared that he was able  to play again. The referee then signaled to continue  the match with him.   Was this the correct decision by the 1st referee?   
Ruling   The decision of the 1streferee was correct. For the  safety of the player, the 1st referee must stop the rally  immediately when an injury occurs and permit the  team doctor and/or medical assistance to enter the  court. If the injury appears to be serious and severe  enough,  the  player  should  be  removed  from  the  court for his/her safe recovery. The principle decision by the 1st referee is to give the  player or/and the team doctor a reasonable time to  know the seriousness of the injury, yet to limit the  time before the substitution is required.   Rules 15.7, 17.1.2   4.33    VIDEO   An accident occurs at the moment of a substitution,  which causes the substitute player’s nose to bleed.  What is the correct procedure?   
Ruling   First  of  all  the  referee  should  request  medical  assistance. It is necessary to stop the game. If the  player cannot recover, the substitution can be cancelled or another substitute player may be chosen by the team.  Since the game has not been resumed, the substitution is not confirmed.            Rules 15.2.3, 15.7   
4.34   The team captain is injured before the start of the  match.   How should the situation be handled?   
Ruling   The process is determined by the moment of the  injury. The main principle is written in rule 4.1.3,  when the score sheet has been signed by captains  and coaches, i.e. after the toss, the team has no right  to change the team roster (except, when the Libero  is injured, has no chance to play and the coach wants  to re-designate the original team captain as the new  Libero).   Based  on  this  if  the  injury  of  the  team  captain  occurred before the toss and he/she cannot play, the  coach should designate a new team captain, putting  a stripe under the number and circling the player's  number in the score sheet. This new team captain  will have all duties and rights (i.e. represents his/her  team at the toss).   If   the    original    team    captain's    injury   occurred after the toss, the coach has no right to  designate another player as team captain. However,  the coach should designate a "general game captain"  who takes the rights and duties of the original team  captain and signs the score sheet after the match.   In both situations the fact of the injury should be  recorded in the score sheet.       Rule 4.1.3, 5.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.2

4.35     VIDEO   What is the correct procedure, if an injured player is  not  able  to  complete   the  substitution  formally  through the substitution zone? (e.g. carried off the  court)?   
Ruling   In  order,  that  the  substitution  is  clear  for  everybody, the substitute player should take the  numbered paddle of the injured player and enter  the substitution zone. The 2nd referee should be  given the paddle to return it to the team.   Rules 15.10.1, 17.1.1   
4.36    VIDEO Mid-rally, two Japanese players fall to the floor. This probably denies the opponent team from winning the rally. Should the referees stop the rally instantly? 
  
 
Ruling According to the latest guidelines, unless there is a danger of further injury or injury to other players, the referees should pause to determine if there really is an injury before interrupting the rally.                                 Rule: 17.1.1, Refereeing    Guidelines & Instructions Rule 13 Item 3 
  4.37    VIDEO The player in the right side team realises that his team will probably lose the rally, and falls to the floor. What is the best way for the referees to treat this situation? 
 
 
Ruling The most up to date guidance to referees is that they should only interrupt the rally if there is a blood injury or a trauma and there is clear danger that the player would suffer additional injury or cause injury to teammates. Since rallies often last no more than 5 seconds, a short pause before automatically whistling might prevent future occurrences. Obvious fakes should be treated as misconduct.                                    Rule: 17.1.1,  Rule 13 Item 3                                   Refereeing Guidelines & Instructions  
4.38      Prior to the start of the third set of a match, the 1st  referee whistled the teams to enter the court. One  team did not react. When they were too slow to  respond, the 1st referee issued a delay warning to  them.   The  team  then  entered  the  court.  Was  this  the  appropriate action by the 1st referee?   
Ruling   Yes, the 1st referee acted correctly. The teams must  be summoned to take their positions on the court. If  they do not react, the 1st referee must issue a delay  warning to them. If the team still did not react, a  delay  penalty  would  have  been  given.  If  this  also  proved to be ineffective, it would have been judged  a refusal to play, the team would have been declared  to be in default and the match would have been  forfeited. In such a case, the score would have been  recorded as 0:3 (0:25, 0:25, 0:25).   If a team is returning slowly to the court after a time-  out, the same procedure should be followed.   Rules 6.4.1, 16.1   

--- Page 35 ---
                                                    Casebook 2024  Page 34/55   
4.39   Will a team be sanctioned for delay if it forms a  huddle on court?   Ruling   There is no requirement for the 1st referee to allow  more than a reasonable time for the players to move  to their positions for the next rally. However, he must  allow for appropriate enthusiasm and cheering but  cannot allow the game to be delayed. The 1st referee  should urge the team to take their position. If he/she  realizes that the players use this behavior as a tactic  for delaying the game consistently, the team should  be sanctioned by delay.  In major competitions, a 15 seconds count down clock is used to regulate the time between rallies; however, when using the clock, the server should always be permitted the 8 seconds after the referee’s whistle to initiate the service action. Rules 16.1.2, 16.1.5   4.40   A player refused to play because of a wet place on  the floor caused by a team member diving for a ball.  What is the proper response of the 1st referee?   
Ruling   Common sense is the key factor here. It is the 1st referee’s responsibility to decide upon the  mopping  requests  by  the  players,  if  they  are  obviously delaying the game, and, if necessary, to  issue a delay sanction for these actions.   When  the  1st  referee  deems  it  necessary to mop the floor by the moppers, he/she  may  give  the  order.  The  control  of  the  match  is  always by the decision of the 1st referee.  Rules 1.5, 5.1.2.2, 6.4.1, 16.2   
4.41 During an interval between two sets, an entire team  went  to  their  locker  room  and  returned  after  5  minutes. The 1st referee issued a delay sanction, and  the game was continued.   Was this an appropriate reaction of the referee?   
Ruling   Firstly, a team is not allowed to leave the competition  area  without  permission  of  the  referees.  Nevertheless, after two and a half minutes, the 2nd  referee should go to the team and remind them to  enter the court immediately so as not to be declared  in default. After they are back on the court, the 1st  referee should issue a delay sanction.   Rules 4.2, 6.4.1, 6.4.2, 18.1   4.42  What is the correct response of the 1st referee if  spectators interrupt the match?   Ruling   The  1st  referee  should  stop  the  match  and  the  organizer  or  the  FIVB Technical Delegate should  take  steps  to  re-establish  the  order.  This  interruption  should be recorded on the score sheet.   Rules 17.2, 17.3

4.43  NEW  VIDEO During the 4th set, when the score was 27-27, first referee penalized the libero player of  team white with a red card for her rude conduct towards the 1st referee (score now 27-28 for the team in black). After the decision of the 1st referee, the coach of team white did not want to continue the game and took the team out of the court as a protest against the original decision of the 1st referee to penalize the libero. After this reaction of the coach, the 1st referee showed a red card to the team coach, and this finished the set and the match.                                  Was the first referee’s decision correct?  
 
Ruling   The red card decision given by the 1st referee is not correct. The referee should have invited the captain of the team that refused to continue the game to the referee’s chair and asked her to bring the team to the playing court for the continuation of the match. If the team  did not react to the invitation  of the referee and still refuses to play, the referee should have sanction the team with either first using a delay or a default sanction.                                            Rules 1.5, 5.1.2.2, 6.4.1, 16.2 
4.44    VIDEO   After a player’s dig in the free zone behind the end  line, directing the ball back into court, the ball hit the  crane camera which had penetrated into the playing  space. The referees should stop the game. How   should the 1st referee consider this action - as “OUT”  or as “external interference”?   
Ruling   Within the playing area the players have the priority  to play. If the ball hits an outside object or a person  penetrating from outside the playing area, e.g. the  crane TV camera it  should  be  considered  as  “external  interference” and the rally should be replayed.   On the video the Libero was about to play the ball  and  continue  the  rally,  but  the  crane  camera  prevented him to do it. This should be considered as  an "external interference" and the rally was to be  replayed.    Had  the  dig  been  misdirected  towards  the  spectators, with no player able to play it, the referee  will not judge this as external interference but ball  OUT.   Rule 17.2   4.45   VIDEO   A middle spiker during the preparation for attack lost  one shoe, which fell down in the front zone. He spiked  the ball then the team lost the rally. After finishing the  rally the middle spiker requested to take back the  shoe. The referees did not intervene either during or  after the rally. How should referees correctly handle  such a situation?   
Ruling   The main principle is the security of the players. If  the referees judge that the shoe, part of the player’s  equipment, creates a dangerous object, they should  stop the game.   Because it was obvious that the player did not lose  the shoe intentionally, his request to take it back  cannot be considered as a delay.   Rule 17.2   4.46   VIDEO   If a player, running to play the ball, clashes into the  referee’s  chair,  should  the  rally  automatically  be  interrupted and replayed?   
Ruling   No.   The  referee  should  judge  if  this  clash  has  an  influence on his/her activity, or caused an injury to the player.  If the referee cannot continue the work normally,  the rally should be stopped and replayed. If there is  no interference due to the clash, let the rally be  continued without any interruption.   Rule 17.2

                                 4.49  NEW   VIDEO  The coach intercepted the attack hit of the opponent, close to the side line, in such a way that there was doubt about whether the ball would have landed in or out. What should the 1st referee do in this instance?    
Ruling  An attack hit which hits the opponent coach in the free zone is out, according to the rules. However, where the coach intercepts the ball close to the line and  the referees/ line judge are unable to determine the final landing point due to the interception, the ball must be considered ball IN and the coach must receive a verbal Warning. In case of a precedent sanction he/she must be given a heavier sanction according to Sanction Scale. Rule 17.2                                                                                                  Casebook 2024 Page 36/55  
4.47     VIDEO After the video review, fans of the losing team moved to the side of the court to demonstrate their disapproval of the result. How should the referees respond?   
Ruling  In this instance, the 2nd referee in particular reacted coolly according to our guidelines about smooth refereeing, and gently guided the spectators back to their seats. Should the demonstration be larger, the referees are empowered to stop the match and request that the organizers restore order.                                                                            Rule:23.2.3 4.48       VIDEO   During the game, due to an inattentive ball retriever,  a second ball rolls onto the court. The situation was  not  realized  by  either  the  1st  referee,  or  the  2nd  referee.  After  the  rally  finished,  the  1st  referee  decided to replay due to external interference. Was it  a correct decision?   
  
Ruling   No, it was not a correct decision. Because the ball entered the court in the very last moment of the rally causing no interference with the game nor risk of injury to the players. The main  principle  is the  security  of the  players.  Therefore, if the referees realize that a second ball is  on the court or is about to roll onto the court, they  should interrupt the rally.   If  the  second  ball  was  sent  onto  the  court  intentionally  by  a  team  member,  the  philosophy  should  be  the  same,  but  this  action  must  be  considered as an aggressive action, leading to the  disqualification of the team member.   As mentioned on case 8.2, if according to the judgement of the 1st referee there is a dangerous situation or a real influence on the continuation of the game, he should stop the game immediately and replay the rally. On the other hand, if the rally is already finished or there is no influence on the outcome, there is no need to judge a replay.  Referees must be able to distinguish between these 2 separate situations. Rule 17.2

 CHAPTER 5 - LIBERO                                                    Casebook 2024  Page 37/55 
5.1  Can  the  Libero  enter  the  game  without  the  2nd  referee’s  permission  after  checking  the  line-up  before the set?   
Ruling   Yes, he can.   The starting player must be on the court at the time  of the line-up check. As soon as the 2nd referee has  checked the line-up, the Libero may replace the back  row player.   Rules 19.3.2.4, 19.3.2.8, 24.3.1   5.2   A team has already applied all legal substitutions in a  set then a player on court is expelled and the Libero  is  sitting  on  the  bench.   How  should  the  match  continue?   
Ruling   The Libero registered on the score sheet is never entitled to become a regular player in the match.   However, an exceptional substitution (not involving the Libero) can be applied, should the coach wish to take this option, but the expelled player would not be permitted to play later in the match in this circumstance. Rules 6.4.3, 15.7,15.8   5.3   Can the Libero be allowed to enter the match by a  regular substitution procedure in place of an injured  player?   
Ruling   No. The Libero is not allowed to participate in any  substitution, regular or exceptional.   Rules 15.5, 15.7, 17   5.4   The Libero was on the court for player #5 and was  expelled from the set. What is the correct process to  continue the match?   
Ruling   If the team has two Liberos, the coach may replace  the  sanctioned  acting  Libero  immediately  by  the  second Libero or by the #5.   If  the  team  has  only  one  Libero,  the  team  may  choose:       to send player #5 back to the court in place of the  Libero  and  play  without  a  Libero  for  the  remainder of the set, or       the coach re-designates a new Libero from the  players not on the court in the moment of re-  designation and the new Libero may immediately  and directly replace the expelled acting Libero  (who is not allowed to play for the remainder of  the match).   Rules 6.4.3, 19.1.1, 19.3.2, 19.3.2.8 5.5    VIDEO   Can a Libero replacement take place at the same time  as a substitution?   Ruling   Yes – because   the “replacement” is not a  “substitution” and vice versa.   Rules 15.3.2, 19.3.2, 19.3.2.8   5.6    VIDEO   The Libero replacing the player in position 1 did it  after the referee’s whistle for service but before the  service hit. What is the proper response by the 1st  referee?   
Ruling   If this was the first occurrence in the match, the 1st  referee  should  allow  the  rally  to  continue  uninterrupted. After the rally, he/she should advise  the game captain that this is not a correct procedure.  Subsequent late replacements should trigger delay  sanctions  immediately,  interrupting  the  rally.  The  Libero replacement remains valid, however.  If the replacement has been made after the service  hit, the 1st referee should whistle this as a positional  fault.   Rule 19.3.2.5

                            5.10 NEW The team captain was injured while on court and had to be substituted. The coach requested that the Libero became the new game captain. Is this permitted?  
Ruling This is permitted. According to the rules, Libero(s) may become team or game captain. Rule 5      
                   Casebook 2024            Page 38/55      
   Ruling   When noticed, the 2nd referee will use the whistle to call  back  the  player.  The  illegal  replacement  will  be  cancelled and the team will be sanctioned for delay.   If noticed after the game continued, the consequences are the same as for an illegal substitution.   Rules 19.3.2.1, 19.3.2.9, 23.2.3   
5.8   While running after a ball, the team's only Libero  (replacing No4) injured his leg muscle and could no  longer play.   The coach then decided that he wanted player No4 to  become the re-designated Libero.   Is this possible?   
Ruling   Not  directly  because  the  replacement  player  is  excepted from a re-designation at the moment of the  request for re-designation.   If the coach wants player No 4 to be the new Libero,  No  4  at  first  has to  return  to  court  replacing  the  injured Libero, and be substituted legally. Then he  can enter the court as the new Libero only after one  completed  rally,  because a second  replacement  cannot be made in the same interruption.   Rules 19.1.3., 19.3.2.2, 19.3.2.8, 19.4.2   5.9.   Is it allowed to be a coach and the Libero at the same  time?   Ruling   Yes.   The rules do not forbid the Libero from being the coach. Rule 5.2.3.4   
event had not yet been recorded on the Libero   control sheet) – but they corrected the mistake   immediately themselves.   Is this counted as a replacement?   
No,  this does  not count as a  replacement, because  there  must  be  one  completed  rally  between  two   Libero replacements. This was an obvious mistake  but should not be counted as a fault.      Rules 19.3.2.1, 19.3.2.2    Ruling   The Libero has no right to play in the front row, and  he has to leave the court after rotating into position 4. The 1st referee has to delay the signal for the next  service for a reasonable time. If the replacement is  still not applied, the team must be reminded about  their obligation and make a Libero replacement and  then they should be sanctioned for any delay caused.   Rules 19.3.1.1, 28.2.2.1, 28.2.2.2   
5.7   A team made an illegal Libero replacement, but it was   noticed before the service hit was made.   How should this be handled?

5.13  The Libero was replaced and immediately sent back  to  the  court  (without  any  rally  between  the  two  replacements).   Is this permitted?   
Ruling   No.  This  is  a  typical  case  for  illegal  Libero  replacement. At the moment of the 2nd replacement  the 2nd referee should reject it, and the 1st referee  should issue a delay sanction. Where an assistant  scorer acts, it is his/her duty to check the Libero  replacements.   In this case, at the moment he/ she should press the  buzzer, signaling the fault committed.   Rules 19.3.2.9, 23.2.3   5.14   The Libero was replaced by a regular player. After the  service, a reserve ball penetrated into the playing  court, and the rally was stopped. Before the whistle  for  the  replayed  rally,  the  Libero  attempted  to  replace the player in position #6. The 2nd referee  called him back.   Is this a correct action by the 2nd referee?   
Ruling   Yes, this is a correct action by the 2nd referee.  This is a case for illegal Libero replacement,  because there was no completed rally between two  Libero  replacements.  At  the  moment  of  the  2nd  replacement the 2nd referee should reject it, and the  1st referee should issue a delay sanction.   Rule19.3.2.1   5.15  The  Libero  of  a  team  became  injured  during  the  match, and the 2nd referee authorized the medical  doctor, with the coach in attendance, to be on the  court for checking the seriousness of the injury. They  decided to take the Libero out of the court and send  the replaced player back on the court. After he was  led  off   the  court,  the   Libero  claimed  he  had  recovered and insisted on returning to the court to  play. The referees allowed the Libero to go back on  the court and to resume the match.   Was this correct?   
Ruling   No, it should not have been allowed. Even though it  was the case of injury, the Libero could be replaced  through a regular replacement. Also, the Libero still  has the right to participate in the match until he/she  is declared unable to continue (Rule 19.4.2).   Thus,  this  situation  was  a  mistake  because  two  consecutive  replacements  took  place  without  any  completed rally in between. This is a case for illegal  Libero replacement.   Rules 19.3.2.1, 19.3.2.8   5.16   The Libero of team ‘A’ injured his/her arm during the  match,  and  a  new  Libero  was  re-designated.  The  original Libero sat on the bench for the remainder of  the match.   Should this have been permitted?   
Ruling   Yes.  The  player  was  mobile,  not  providing  any  obstruction or  danger  to himself/herself or team-  mates.   This  last  point  is  crucial  to  the ruling.  The  player  should be permitted to stay on the bench. Had the  player to be treated, the team doctor should have  been advised to place the player behind the bench or  in a place of safety outside the FOP.        Diagram 1a and Definitions.  Rule 19.3.2.8   
5.17 When can two Libero replacements take place in the  same interruption for the same team?   Ruling   Only in 2 cases can 2 Libero replacements take place  in the same interruption.   1. when a penalty has been issued    2. when  immediately  after  the  Libero entered  the   court, a rally became incomplete due to the injury  of the Acting Libero   Rules 6.1.3, 19.3.2.1

5.18   The Acting Libero complained of feeling sick.  Is it permitted to re-designate a new Libero?   Ruling   If the team has two Liberos, in case of injury or illness  of the Acting Libero, he/she can be replaced by the  second Libero. In the case where a team has only one  Libero or the second Libero has become unable to  play, he/she can be replaced by the re-  designation procedure.                   Rules 19.3.2.2   5.19   The scorer recorded the number ‘15’ for the Libero,  instead  of  “5”.  The  coach  and  the  team  captain  signed the team list.   What should happen if discovered?   
Ruling   This is an administrative mistake and will not have  any  consequences  for  the  team.  The  scorer  will  correct the number in the ‘Remarks’ box.   Rule 19.1.2   5.20   In the 1st set of a match, the Libero of ‘A’ played in a  shirt with the same color and design as the rest of  the team. Before the start of the 2nd set, the coach of  ‘B’  protested  against  this  situation.  What  is  the  correct decision?   
Ruling   Because the wrong shirt had no influence on the  game, the result of the 1st set will not be cancelled  and no sanction is to be issued to team ‘A’. The FIVB Technical Delegate will decide if  the Libero  has to change his/her shirt, however.   Rule 19.2   5.21   Two players tried to block an opponent’s attack and  jumped at the net. Between them the Libero also  jumped, but didn’t reach at any time with any part of  his   body   higher   than   the   top   of   the   net.  Nevertheless, the 2nd referee whistled this as block  attempt. Was this decision correct?   
Ruling   The  decision  was  not  correct.  Because the Libero  didn`t reach at any time with any part of his body  higher than the top of the net, his jumping could  not be considered as a block attempt.   Rules 14.1.1, 14.1.2,          14.1.3, 14.1.4, 14.6.6     5.22   The Libero came off court. The server was whistled  for a delay in service (8 seconds).   Can the Libero now re-enter the court?   
Ruling   Yes, he can. This service (fault) is to be considered as a completed  rally. Therefore, the Libero will be allowed to re-enter  the court.   Rules 6.1.3, 19.3.2.1, 19.3.2   
5.23   The coach declared the single Libero unable to play  and wanted to re-designate a new Libero.   Who can be re-designated as the new Libero and  when?   
Ruling   Except for the regular replacement player, any player  on the bench at the moment of the request for re-  designation can be re-designated as the new Libero.  The original Libero cannot come back into the match  at any time.   If the coach wants the regular replacement player to  be  the  new  Libero,  he/she  first  must  substitute  him/her legally.   If the Acting Libero is declared unable to play, he/she  must be replaced by the regular replacement player  and the new Libero has the right to enter the court  after  one  completed  rally, Rules 19.3.2.8, 19.4.2.1, 19.4.2.4

5.24     VIDEO  A team had 2 Liberos recorded, No. 11 and 16. The  latter wore a shirt with the same color and design  as  the  normal  players  of  the  team.  The  team  requested  a  substitution  and  the  player  No.  16  appeared  in  the  substitution  zone to substitute  a  player on  court. The  scorer  immediately signaled  that this request was not a legal one. How should the  game continue?   
Ruling   The Libero has no right to take part either by legal, or  exceptional substitution. Therefore, the substitution  request  should  be  considered  as  an  illegal  one.  Because  this  was  discovered  before  the  game  resumed, the request should be denied and a delay  sanction should be issued for the faulty team.   The Libero has to change his/her shirt, however.  The referees should control carefully the teams and  the players’ uniform comparing the players and shirt  numbers before the match in due time, in order to  avoid such a situation.   Rule 15.5.1, 15.7, 16.1.3, 19.2      Ruling    Yes, it is allowed.   It is not forbidden to declare both Liberos unable to  play at the same time. None of original Liberos may  re-enter the match after the re-designation, but they  have the right to sit on the bench or to be in the  warming-up area.   Rule 19.4.2.1, 19.4.2.2   5.26    VIDEO Receiving a fake attack by the setter of team B the  ball was played with the fingers of one hand over the  head by the Libero of team A standing in the front  zone. This ball was spiked by a teammate completely  over the height of the net in the moment of the hit.  What is the consideration of the judgement, if this  action was legal or illegal?   
Ruling   Based on the approach of the rule, if the Libero’s  action is done with opened fingers like a classical,  intentional set, it is considered as a fault. However, if  the Libero protects the body/face instead of setting,  it should be a legal play.   Rule 13.3.6.,19.3.1.4.   
5.25 A team had 2 Liberos recorded. After the 2nd set the   coach declared both Liberos unable to play and re-   designated  one  new  Libero  to  replace  them.  Is  it   allowed?

 CHAPTER 6 – PARTICIPANTS’ CONDUCT                                                     Casebook 2024  Page 42/55  
 6.1       The         T The   1st referee warned a player for minor  misconduct Ruling   This is a correct action by the referee. Such minor  misconducts must be controlled by the 1st referee.  The yellow card must be recorded.   The 1st referee may give a verbal warning to the team  via  the  game  captain  (stage  1)  if  the  minor  misconduct is of a general nature.   Although,  depending  of  the  seriousness  of  minor  misconduct he/she may start with stage 2 showing a  yellow card directly to the concerned player or team  member through the game captain.   Rules 21.1, 21.2   
 going directly to STAGE 2 of the minor  misconduct      procedures, and showing the player a  yellow card, to     be recorded on the score sheet.    Is this a correct action by the 1st referee?   
6.2   The 2nd referee observed an attempted deception (a  blocker pulled the net) and whistled for the attacking  team to win the rally. The 1st referee then signaled a  warning to the player by using a yellow card.   Is this the correct penalization for him/her?   
Ruling   The decision of the 1st referee was not correct.   The  rally  should  have  been  won  by the  attacking  team because of the net contact by the opposite  player which interfered with the play. The blocker  then should have received a penalty for the rude  conduct of attempting to mislead the referees.   Rules 21.2.1, 21.3   6.3   The Coach of ‘A’ stood up at the end of a rally and  waved his arms in a manner that suggested disgust  with the referee’s decision.   Is this allowed?   
Ruling   The  coach  should  be  allowed  to  express  certain  normal responses and the referee should just calm down him/her without any further consequences.  But, if the response is judged to be  minor  misconduct  reaching  the  stage  2  level,  the  coach should be warned by the 1st referee by use of  a yellow card. If repeated, he should be penalized  with a red card for rude conduct.    Rules 5.2, 21.1, 21.2, 21.3   6.4    Between sets a penalty for rude conduct was given  by the 1st referee to Team ‘A’ which had the first  service for the next set.   What happens next?   
Ruling   Sanctions imposed between sets are set against the  next set. Thus, before the first service, the 1st referee  should signal the penalty for team A. The team B  gains one point, rotates and serves.   The following is a summary of infractions which occur  between  sets,  the  penalties  for  which  must  be  recorded on the score sheet:     Warning against a member of any team (yellow   card).     Penalty  against  a  serving  team  member.  The   receiving team gains a point, rotates and gains the  service.    Penalty against a receiving team member. Point   awarded to the serving team.

   Penalties against each team no matter in which   order.   Each team gains a point (score 1-1) and each team  rotates one position.   The score is counted only when each team has  been penalized.            Rule 21.5      Ruling   No. Because the net touch shown on the video occurred  after the rally, cannot be considered as a technical  fault.   Regarding the misconduct aspect according to Rule  21.3, the 1st referee has the authority to sanction a  player according to the seriousness of the offence.  Pulling down the net may be a normal emotional  reaction  of   a  disappointed  player   and   can  be  controlled by the smooth refereeing. In some cases,  intentional  pulling  down  of  the  net  may  be  considered as a rude conduct, e.g during the rally  misleading the referee and/or the opponent. Rules 21.2, 21.2.1, 21.3, Refereeing Guidelines and   Instructions 24.7   6.6   A player walked towards the 1st referee gesturing  wildly and shouting to him even after a warning.  How should we consider this action?   
Ruling   This should be regarded as Offensive Conduct, and  sanctioned by Expulsion, red and yellow cards jointly.   Rules 21.1, 21.2, 21.3   6.7   A player was expelled directly from the court with no  prior warning.   How  should  we  regard  a  subsequent  minor  misconduct  from  any  other  member  of  the  same  team?   
Ruling   The 1st referee should normally try to prevent a team  from reaching the sanctioning level.   However, should a clear case of offensive conduct be  committed  in the  first  instance,  the  referee  must  expel the player without a previous sanction.   The 1st referee may issue a warning to other team  members after the expulsion – but once the yellow  card is shown, it may not be shown again to any  member of the team.                 Rule 21  6.8    NEW Player No 5 was expelled from the set. Where does this player go after leaving the court?   
Ruling The expelled player must return to the team dressing room (escorted by the Reserve Referee) for the duration of the set in progress. After the end of the set, this player must return to the competition area. Rule 21.3.2.1, D9a 6.9    NEW     VIDEO At the service hit, the 2nd referee whistles a position fault against the receiving team. The coach protests angrily and argues with the 2nd referee that his team’s positions were correct “according to the new rules”, and he went beyond any limits telling the referee repeatedly: “You don’t know the rules”.  
Ruling This is a case where the 1st referee needs to protect the 2nd referee. The coach’s actions and words go beyond an acceptable level. By allowing this behaviour it makes the coach the focus of everyone’s attention. Despite the R2 taking a reasoned approach to explain to the Game Captain, the coach continued his protests, and attempts to undermine the R2 decision. The 1st referee should have sanctioned with a Penalty this rude behavior from the coach.                                                                                                   Rule 21 
6.5       VIDEO  After the end of a rally, the setter pulled down the   bottom of the net.   Should this have been a fault?

                            CHAPTER 7 – THE REFEREES AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES                            Casebook 2024  Page 44/55 
6.10   After the match one team captain showed very  unsportsmanlike behavior towards the 1st referee.  What is the correct procedure of the 1st referee?   
Ruling   The player must still be sanctioned in some way.  However, for FIVB events, since the match is  regarded as not finished by the last whistle of the  referees, the behavior of the team captain must be  reported to the FIVB Technical Delegate, and the details of the  misconduct recorded in the REMARKS box of the  score sheet. The FIVB Control Committee has a range  of sanctions at its disposal, including suspension from  the Competition.   6.11  The Libero replacement was sitting on the bench. The  1st referee sanctioned him by issuing a penalty. The  player did not stop his behavior and applauded the  referee.  The  1st  referee  sanctioned  him  with  an  expulsion. The  expelled  player  continued  the  behavior and received a disqualification.   What is the correct procedure to continue the match?   
Ruling   Since the Libero cannot play in the front court, the expelled or disqualified player must be  substituted immediately, by a regular or exceptional substitution.   This can be done without the Libero having to leave the court, or the team having to play without a replacement player.  After the administration of the sanction, the coach (or captain) should, by use of the appropriate hand signal,  simply inform the relevant referee about which number of player is substituting for the disqualified player. This is recorded on the score sheet.  Rules 6.4.3, 15.5.2, 15.8, 21.3.3.1, 21.4.3   7.1   The 2nd referee told a coach not to talk with or distract the scorer.   Is this a correct action by the 2nd referee?   
Ruling   Yes, this is correct by the 2nd referee. In the spirit of smooth refereeing, if such situations  can be resolved by the 2nd referee without formality,  this should be done.   Rule 23.3.2.2   7.2   Can a reserve player sit on the floor in the warm-up  area instead of standing or stretching?   Ruling   Yes, Players are not required to stand in the warm-up  area.  On  the  other  hand,  players  may  not  sit  on  benches, chairs, rails or walls in the warm-up area, unless for an special reason permitted by the FIVB Technical Delegate.   Rules 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 24.2.4, 24.2.5   7.3   Can a coach ask the scorer for information about the  number of time-outs that had been taken by the  other team?   
Ruling   The scorer should not respond to the coach.  Generally, coaches are not permitted to ask the  scorers for any information.   However, where an electronic scoreboard is used,  but the number of used game interruptions is not  indicated,  the  coaches  have  the  right  to  ask  the  scorer for this information, but only about their own  team and at a time which is neither distracting to the  scorer nor delaying the match.   Rule 27.2.2

                                        Casebook 2024  Page 45/55
7.4  Can a captain make a formal protest on the score  sheet  if  he  has  not  notified  the  referee  of  his  intention during the match?   
Ruling   If at the time of any incident, the game captain made  no mention of a protest, he cannot make a written  protest on the score sheet at the end of the match.   Rules 5.1.2.1, 5.1.3.2, 23.2.4   7.5   Can a refereeing decision be reversed even after the  end of the set?            
Ruling   Yes. Up to the start of the next set, referees are  allowed to correct their decisions immediately   concerning the application of the rules, if they realize they were mistaken. The match score will be   corrected as appropriate.   7.6   After a request for a third time out was refused as an  improper request, the coach changed her mind and  sent a player for substitution.   Is this allowed?   
Ruling   Provided  there  was  no  whistle  for  service,  the  request for substitution should have been allowed as  proper – only the time out was improper. However,  the  improper  request  for  time-out  should  be  recorded on the score sheet.   Rules 15.1, 15.2.1, 15.11,  16.1, 16.2, 24.2.6, 24.2.7   7.7   During a time-out a coach met with his entire team in  the very back corner of the free zone near the warm-  up zone.   Is this permitted?   
Ruling   The team must “go to the free zone near their bench”  during a time-out and the 2nd referee should tell the  team to do so.   Rule 15.4.2   7.8   The assistant coach came to the side line to assist the  players to find a wet spot.   The  1st  referee  called  the  game  captain  and  told  him/her to tell the assistant coach to stay on the  bench.   Did the 1st referee make a correct decision?   
Ruling   The  decision  of  the  1st  referee  was  correct.  The  assistant coach is allowed to sit on the bench and  may not intervene in the match. Only the coach may  walk near the side line.   Rules 5.2.3.4, 5.3.1   
7.9   After a rally a coach asked the 2nd referee if his server  was correct. The 2nd referee checked the rotational  order with the scorer and replied that the correct  player was ready to serve. The 1st referee continued  the match.   Is this the correct process of the referees?   
Ruling   Although the only team member  allowed  to  speak  with  the  referees  is  the  game  captain, this short interaction between the coach and the 2nd referee do not affect the game at all. Thus, the  2nd  referee may answer certain request from the coach in favor of the smooth refereeing.    Refereeing Guidelines & Instructions…. Rule 5.1.2     7.10       VIDEO   Has the 1st referee the right to whistle positional fault  at the receiving team?   Ruling   No.  The 1st referee must NOT whistle this fault because he/she cannot see this fault at the exactly moment it is committed! However, the 1st referee has the right to overrule the  decision of any member of the refereeing team on  the match.   Rule 23.2.1.

 CHAPTER 8 –  SPECIAL CASES                                                 
 Casebook 2024  Page 46/55
8.1  Team ‘B’ intentionally slowed down the tempo of the  game.   How should the referee respond?            
PRINCIPLE   The referee should keep the game at a constant  tempo within the normal flow of the game. The   referee should never allow any external influences to  retard the flow of a match and ruin the good   performance of one of the teams.    8.2   A floor wiping towel from one of the players of ‘B’ fell  on the court of A.   What should the referees do?   
Ruling   If, according to the judgment of the 1st referee, the  situation  is  dangerous,  he  should  stop  the  game  immediately and direct a replay. But if the rally is  finished and the falling towel will have no influence  on its outcome, there is no need to direct a replay.   Rule 17.2   8.3 The match was resumed on another playing court  after the lights failed.   What is the correct ruling on the use of a disqualified  player in the third set when it started again?   
Ruling   The interrupted set has to be cancelled and replayed  with the same team members and the same starting  line-ups but neither disqualified nor expelled players  are allowed to participate Another player who was  on the team and not in the starting line-up must take  his place.   Furthermore,  all  other  warnings/sanctions  which  have been recorded on the score sheet up to the  point that the lights went out must be carried over  into the new set.   Rule 17.3.2.2   8.4   VIDEO   When passing the net post to retrieve a 1st hit passing  outside the antenna, a player grabbed the referee’s  chair to turn rapidly enough to get to the ball.   Is this taking support?   
Ruling   No. To judge, if the action was legal, the moment of  the playing the ball is the crucial point. Because the  player did not take any support while he was hitting  the ball, his action cannot be judged as an assisted  hit. Legal and attractive play.   Rule 9.1.3   
8.5   VIDEO   After  a  substitution,  based  on  the  result  of  the  challenge procedure the 1streferee had to change her  original decision and ordered to replay the rally. The  coach  therefore  requested  to  reverse  the  substitution. Is this possible?   
Ruling   Since the 1st referee changed his/her decision, which  was the basis of the substitution,  the  coach’s  request must be  accepted.  No  substitution would be charged against this team.   
8.6  NEW  VIDEO During an attack, the ball rebounded from the net band (or the opponent block). As it did so, the antenna detached itself from the net. It was already in the process of falling down, when the ball was contacted again by the red team.   What should be the 1st referee’s decision? 
Ruling   The video review suggests that the ball actually came off the block. However, in any case, because the antenna had detached fractionally before any red player contacted the ball, the rally should be replayed. The 1st referee was correct in immediately calling for a replay

                             CHAPTER 9 – USING TECHNOLOGY CASES  Technology has been used for some years now by FIVB, it’s Confederations and affiliated National Federations. This includes the use of headsets, e-scoresheet and Video Challenge System (VCS) technology. Each of these provides benefits to the sport, but their use requires close attention from the referees in order that the match is directed in smooth manner. a              Casebook 2024  Page 47/55
8.7 NEW In Set 3, the team scores are 9-7. Team with 7 points is suddenly found to have two number 11s on court. Apparently one player  played sets one and two with number 10, as legally registered and recorded on the score sheet, but when she changed her wet jersey/ uniform shirt  between sets 2 and 3 she mistakenly put on a Number 11.  Neither player had served during set 3. The 1st Referee instructed the player to change to her original number, and awarded a delay sanction against the team. Was this the correct action by the 1st referee? 
Ruling   Yes, the referee was correct. Both the scorer and second referee should have noticed before the start of the set that there were two number 11s, and should have corrected the situation at that moment. In this unusual situation, not exactly covered in the rules, the 1st referee has the power to decide such matters. However, as the player was legally registered on the score sheet, and was actually on the line up sheet with the correct number (number 10) rule 7 cannot apply here. Hence, the 1st referee was correct NOT to deduct points from the team. As the team was responsible, at least in part, for the match being interrupted, a delay sanction was correctly applied, and the player should play on with the correct uniform number. The match should continue with the scores as they were at the moment the error was discovered. In summary: 23.2.3 He/she has the power to decide any matters involving the game, including those not provided for in the rules * change the uniform back to the correct number; * charge the team for delay      Rule 7.3.5.4; 23.2.3 
9.1    NEW The Challenge Referee’s headset failed mid-match. What is the best solution to continue the match and maintain Challenge capability?  
Ruling   Spare headsets should be located with the Challenge Referee. While the complete communication network remains ideal, if spares are not to hand, the scorer must function without a headset, and can interact with the referees with hand signals, or by face to face dialogue with the 2nd referee. The Challenge Referee must therefore receive the scorer’s push-to-talk headset.                       Decision of the R&RGC

9.2    NEW Data for two substitutions was sent by the assistant coach.  However, a different pair of players entered the substitution zone. What should the 2nd referee / 3rd referee and scorer do? 
Ruling   The actual request is the entrance of the substitute player(s) into the substitution zone. The electronic team tablet (ETT) in this case does not over-ride the rule text. The technology is designed to help, but human error can occur, and must not be used as a basis of refusing the substitution. The 2nd referee (or 3rd referee) and scorer should simply accept the players who enter the substitution zone, provided they are legal. The scorer should accept on the e-score one by one rather than “accept all”. The scorer should speak the phrase “going manual” through the headset, so that the 2nd referee knows to allow a little more time for the scorer to “drag and drop” the new players into the line-up on the e-score computer. Rule: 15.10.3.1, 15.10.4   9.3   NEW  In an FIVB World competition, numbered paddles were not used. Is this correct? Ruling   In top level events, played over a lengthy period, larger squads are permitted, so numbers may be up to 99, for example.  As a consequence, numbered paddles are impractical. Additionally, the paddles can create multiple mistakes in themselves, leading to possible and undesirable delay sanctions.  Not using the paddles here is the better option. However, where full technology is not used, and where squad numbers are according to normal practice, the paddles should still be used. Rule: 15.10.3.3   9.4    NEW  Using  the  Tablet,  the  coach  transmits  data  for  a   time out a fraction of a second before the scorer presses start rally, but crucially  the 1st referee’s whistle.  The players are walking to the bench as the opponent serves into an empty court.                                          What should the 1st referee do to maintain the integrity of the game? 
Ruling    The 1st referee can apply the concept of smooth     refereeing to avoid confusion..  Here, the situation was precipitated by the scorer’s inattention, as the time out horn should have been automatically disengaged by the start rally button.  The 1st referee could use discretion here, to help the image of the sport, by converting the service signal smoothly into a time out signal. Rule: 15.11.1, 15.11.1.1,16.1.4 9.5 NEW  VIDEO During the rally, the ball strikes the net then penetrates completely to the opponent side, before being recovered. The complete penetration was only confirmed to the challenging team when it challenged for net fault. 
Ruling   The rules state that the ball is “out” when it passes completely under the net.  According to the Challenge Regulations, the first fault which is seen during the video verification, even if not the action which is being challenged, will decide the  rally. Here, although the challenge was for net fault, and there was no net fault, the 1st referee was able to confirm his original decision that the ball was played when completely on the side of the USA team. This is the fault whistled. On the other hand, this situation happened because the net was not as taut as it should have been. This must be checked and fixed before the match and controlled during the match, to avoid situations similar to this causing a “bitter” taste to the teams.                         Rules:8.4.5

9.6 A player listed on the line-up transmitted by the   team was injured before the start of the match. What happens with the electronic score sheet?  
Ruling   Transmitted line ups count in the same way as a written and signed line up sheet. Therefore, the player may be replaced but this would count as a substitution, unless special rules are applied for the given event. Rules:7.3.2, 7.3.4 
9.7 A player arrived in correct time in the substitution zone – but no data had been transmitted. How is this handled?   
Ruling   The official request for  substitution  is  when  the  substitute  player(s)  enter  the  substitution  zone.  Therefore, the scorer, before  any  action,  should  check if the request is legal.   If it is, he/ she should accept the request manually, and speak into the microphone “going manual”, to prepare for allowing a little more time for the administration of the exchange of players.   If the request is illegal, it should be rejected and the referees have to follow the respective rules.       Rules 15.5.1, 16.1.3   9.8  NEW     VIDEO After a Challenge, it was clear that the Video Challenge Operators had shown the wrong video clip.             What option does the 1st referee have in this circumstance? 
Ruling   The 1st referee must appreciate that the Video Challenge System is designed to ensure fairness, as far as possible in decision making.  Hence, the 1st referee should insist that the correct video is shown, and should simply not accept unconditionally.                                             Decision of the R&RGC  9.9   NEW     VIDEO Where the Video Challenge System operates, teams are allowed to challenge for suspected faults perhaps missed by the referees. If the opponent admits the fault, how should the 1st referee react?  
Ruling   In the spirit of fair play, the admission by the opponent is welcome. The 1st referee can, therefore, accept the player’s admission and hence prevent the challenge being required or cancel the challenge process. In the 2023 edition of the VNL Finals, the Fair Play Moment was tested, to avoid the waste of time for video revision when a team recognizes the block touch or the net touch. Rules:7.3.2, 7.3.4
